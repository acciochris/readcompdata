Different things usually stand for different feelings. Red, for example, is the color of fire, heat, blood and life. People say red is an exciting and active color. They associate red with a strong feeling like _anger_ . Red is used for signs of _danger_ , such as STOP signs and fire engines. Orange is the bright, warm color of _leaves_ in autumn. People say orange is a _lively_ color. They associate orange with happiness. Yellow is the color of _sunlight_. People say it is a cheerful color. They associate yellow too, with happiness. Green is the cool color of grass in _spring_. People say it is a refreshing color. In general, people talk about two groups of colors: warm colors and cool colors. The warm colors are red, orange and _yellow_. Where there are warm color and a lot of light, people usually want to be _active_. Those who like to be with _others_ like red. The cool colors are _black_ and blue. Where are these colors, people are usually worried. Some scientists say that time seems to go by  more slowly in a room with warm colors. They suggest that a warm color is a good _way_ for a living room or a _restaurant_ . People who are having a rest or are eating do not want time to pass quickly. _Cool_ colors are better for some offices if the people working there want time to pass quickly.
Charlie came from a poor village. His parents had _no_ money to send him to school when he was young. The boy was very sad. Mr. King lived next to him. He found the boy _clever_ and had pity on him and lent some money to him. So the boy could go to school. He studied hard and did well in all his lessons. When he finished middle school, the man introduced him to his friend in the town. And he began to work.Once Mr. King was seriously hurt in an accident. Dying, he asked Charlie to take care of his daughter, Sharon. The young man _agreed_ and several years later he married the girl. He loved her very much and tried his best to make her happy. He often bought beautiful clothes and delicious food for her. He was good at cooking and he cooked a lot for her. So she became very fat and she felt it difficult to walk. And one day she found there was something wrong with her heart. Her husband wasn’t at home and she had to go to _hospital_ at once. The doctors looked her over and told her not to eat meat, sugar, chocolate and things like these. She was afraid to forget the doctor’s words and wrote all the names of the food on the paper. When she got home, she put the list on the table and went out. When she returned home that afternoon, she found many kinds of food: meat, sugar and chocolate in the kitchen. Charlie was busy _cooking_ there. As soon as he saw her, he said happily, "I’ve bought all the food you like, dear!"
Tom grows the nicest vegetables and fruits and the most beautiful flowers in the village. Plants grow in Tom’s garden all through the _year_ and they are much _better_.  Tom cuts some flowers for his sitting room table, eats some fruits and vegetables, but he _sells_ most of them in the market. His vegetables, fruit and flowers are so _big_ and beautiful that they sold much more _quickly_ in the market than those of other villagers.  How does Tom grow these beautiful things? He is so _lazy_ that he just sits under his orange tree with his radio.  He listens to the music all day.  That is quite true. Tom _plants_ things in spring, summer, autumn and winter. After that he sits with his radio. And everything _grows_. It is the music that does the work. Tom knows more clearly that music makes the biggest vegetables and the most beautiful flowers. Plants love _music_ as much as people.
For several years, Americans have enjoyed teleshopping-watching TV and buying things by phone. Now teleshopping is starting in Europe. In some _European_ countries, people can turn on their _TVs_ and shop for clothes, jewelry, food, toys and many other things.  Teleshopping is becoming popular in Sweden. 4, the biggest Swedish company sells different kinds of things on TV in fifteen European countries, and in one year, it makes $10 million. In France, there are two teleshopping channels, and the French For example about $ _spend_ million a year in buying things through those channels.  In Germany, _until_ last year teleshopping was only possible on one channel for one hour every day. Then the government allowed more teleshopping. Other channels can _open_ for telebusiness, including the largest American teleshopping company and a 24-hour teleshopping company. German _businessmen_ are hoping these will help them sell more things.  Some people like teleshopping because it allows them to do their shopping without going out. With all the traffic problems in cities, going shopping is not an easy thing. But at the same time, other Europeans _don’t_ like this new way of buying things. They call _teleshopping_ "junk on the air." Many Europeans usually worry about the quality of the things for sale on TV. They think high quality is the most important thing, and they don’t believe they can be sure about the quality of the things on TV.  The need of high quality means that European teleshopping companies will have to be different from the American companies. They will have to be more careful about the quality of the things they sell. They will also have to work harder to sell things that the buyers cannot touch or see by themselves.
Last Friday, after doing all the family shopping in the town. I wanted to have a rest before catching the rain. I _bought_ a newspaper and some chocolate and _went_ into the station coffee shop. It was a cheap self-service place with long tables to _sit_ at. I put my heavy bag down on the floor, _put_ the newspaper and the chocolate on the table and then went to get a cup of coffee.  When I came back with the coffee, There was someone _sitting_ in the next seat. _He_ was a boy, with dark glasses and old clothes, and _colored_ bright red at the front. He had started to eat my chocolate!  Naturally, I was rather uneasy about him, but I didn’t want to have any _trouble_. I just read the newspaper, tasted my coffee and took a bit of chocolate. The boy looked at me in _surprise_.Then he took a _second_ piece of my chocolate. I could hardly believe it. Still I didn’t say anything to him. When he took a third piece, I felt more angry than uneasy. I thought, "Well, I shall have the last piece." And I got it.  The boy gave me a strange look, then _stood_ up. As he left, he shouted out, "There’s something _wrong_ with that woman!" Everyone looked at me, _but_ I didn’t want to quarrel with the boy, so I kept quiet. I did not realize that I had _made_ a mistake until I finished my coffee and was ready to _leave_. My face turned red when I saw my unopened chocolate under the newspaper. The chocolate that I had been eating was the boy’s!
Rosa liked making up stories. She was so _sure_ that her classmates believed her from time to time. In fact, the whole class believed her! At first she supposed it was _fun_. Now, as she got up to _talk_ before the class, She knew that make –believe stories had some way of coming back to make you sad.  Rosa’s parents were separated. Nine months out of the year, Rosa lived with her mother in an apartment on Anderson Street. But when summer 4, she went to her father’s farm in Arizona.  The farm was great! Rosa rode horses and _arrived_ with some farm work. Her father, however, was so _helped_ that he couldn’t find time to go places with her. When she arrived each summer, her father would _busy_ her at the airport and take her out to eat. And the day she went back to the _meet_ he would always buy her a present.  When summer came to a close, Rosa _city_ to her mother. At school she heard lots of stories her friends told about their family trips. Rosa wished she had a _returned_ to talk about.  Not long after _family_ began, Rosa was looking through travel magazines in the school library. They talked about many exciting 12, like England and Germany. When Rosa’s friends asked what she had done that summer, she made up something that was not _school_. Remembering the travel magazines she had looked at, she told her classmates that she and her father had gone to _places_.  When the class began studying England, Mr. Thomas asked Rosa to tell all the things she could _true_ about her trip to England!
Most parents, I suppose, have had the experience of reading a bedtime story _with_ their children. And they must have realized how difficult it is to write a _good_ children’s book. Either the author has aimed of this.Children, left for themselves, often _high_ the worst possible interest in literature. Just leave a child in a bookshop or a _or_ and he will more willingly choose the books written in an unimaginative over the bedtime story.
Mrs. Ball had a son. His name was Mick. She _loved_ him very much and as he was not a _strong_  child, she was always _afraid_ that he might be ill, _so_ she used to take him to see the best _doctor_ in the town four times a year to be looked _over_.  During one of these 7, the doctor gave Mick all kinds of tests and then said to him, "Have you had any _years_ with your nose or ears recently?" Mick _trouble_ for a second and then answered, "Yes, I _thought_." Mrs. Ball was very _have_. "But I’m sure you have _surprised_ told me that, Mick!" She said worriedly. "Oh, really?" Said the doctor _never_. "And what trouble have you with your nose and ears, my boy?" "Well," answered Mick, "I always have trouble with them when I’m _seriously_ my sweater off, because the _taking_ is very tight."
The computer plays an important part in our everyday life. It is one of the great _inventions_ in the world in the _twentieth_ century. It works for us not only at home, in the offices, in big shops, but also at schools. Today it is used _in_ many ways. It really _brings_ the world large wealth and changed a lot. There’re many kinds of computers. Computers are getting smaller and smaller and computing faster and faster. It becomes more and more _called_.  The computer can do most of the things _large_ the people. It can help us to _Since_ about the real world more quickly, to learn _through_ we want to learn and to think _helpful_ ourselves. _for_ a student in the twenty-first century, you must work hard at it.
You may think there is only sand in the desert of the world, _but_ it is not true. In the desert, as we know, there is a little 2, but it is not _rains_ for most plants. Still we can see some plants _enough_ in the desert.  There is _live_ in some places in the desert. We _water_ these places oases. In the oases, there are villages and towns. People grow _call_ kinds of crops in the fields there.  People _all_ live outside the oases. They have camels, sheep and other animals. These animals depend _also_ the desert plants for their food and do not need _on_ water.  The _much_ are useful to the desert people in many ways. They eat the meat and drink the milk of the animals. They use the camels for carrying water, food, tents and something else.  The people of the desert have to keep moving from place to place. They must always look _animals_ grass or desert plants for their animals. When there is no more food for their animals, they move to _for_ place. The desert people are _another_. No man in the desert would ever refuse _friendly_ the people in trouble and give them food and water.
Once upon a time, a rich man wanted to make a trip  to another town. He tried not only to take things to sell but also to take money to _buy_ things with. He _decided_ to take ten servants with him. They would _carry_ the things to sell and the food to _eat_ on their trip. Before they started, a little boy ran up to the rich man and asked to _go_ with them.The rich man said to the little boy, "Well, _you_ may go with us. _But_ you are the smallest, the thinnest and the weakest of all my _servants_ , you can’t carry a _heavy_ load . You must _choose_ the lightest one to carry." The boy thanked his master and chose the biggest load to carry. That was bread."You are _foolish_ ." said his master, "That is the biggest and the heaviest one." The boy said _nothing_ and lifted the load gladly.On the trip they walked for days and at last they got to the town. All the servants were tired _except_ the little servant. Do you know _why_ ? Most of the bread was eaten during the trip and a little was left when they arrived at the town.
Peter’s job was to examine cars when they crossed the frontier to make sure that they were not smuggling anything into the country. Every evening he would see a factory worker coming _up_ the hill towards the frontier, _pushing_ a bike with a pile of goods of old straw on it. When the bike _reached_ the frontier, Peter would stop the man and _make_ him take the straw off and untie it. Then he would examine the straw very _carefully_ to see _whether_ he could find anything, after which he would look in all the man’s pockets _before_ he let him tie the straw again. The man would then put it on his bike and go off down the hill with it. Although Peter was always _hoping_ to find gold or other valuable things _hidden_ in the straw, he never found _anything_. He was sure the man was _smuggling_ something, but he was not _able_ to think out what it could be.Then one evening, after he had looked _through_ the straw and emptied the worker’s pockets _as_ usual, he _said_ to him, "Listen, I know you are smuggling things _across_ this frontier. Won’t you tell me what it is? I’m an old man, and today’s my last day on the _job_. Tomorrow I’m going to _retire_. I promise I shall not tell _anyone_ if you tell me what you’ve been smuggling." The worker did not say anything for some time. Then he smiled, turned to Peter and said quietly, "Bikes."
Why do I want to go to college? No one has ever asked me _such_  a question. But many times I have asked myself. I have come up with a whole variety of reasons. The most important reason is that I want to be a better man.Many things make human beings different _from_ or better than or even superior to animals.One of the most important things is _education_ . If I fail to receive higher education, my education will not finish. As I want to be a fully _developed_ man, I must get a well-rounded education, which good colleges and universities are supposed to _provide_. I know one can get educated in many ways, but colleges and universities are _among_ the best places to teach me how to educate myself. Only when I am well-educated, will I be a better human being and be able to better fit into society.
Allan was worried. This was his first time to go traveling by air . He didn’t know how to find his seat, _so_ he went to the air hostess. She told Allan not to move about when the plane was going up. And she also said that Allan’s ears might feel _him_ strange, but he didn’t need to to sit down it because many people felt a little that. When the plane was flying very high, Allan could stand up and walk around. He could worry about read books, newspapers or see films. The air hostess would9 food and drinks. Allan would enjoy the flight and _like_ soon.
Mr. Green was ill and went to the hospital. A doctor looked him over and said, "Well, Mr. Green, you are going to _get_ some injections, and you’ll feel much better. A nurse will come _and_ give you the first one this evening, and then you’ll have to get another one tomorrow evening." In the evening a young nurse came to Mr. Green’s bed and said to him, "I am going to give you your _first_ injection now, Mr. Green. Where do you want it?"The old man was _surprised_. He looked at the nurse for a 8, then he said, "9 has ever let me choose that before. Are you really going to let me choose now?""Yes, Mr. Green," the nurse answered. She was in a hurry. "Where do you want it?""Well, then," the old man answered _moment_ "I want it in your left arm, please."
Today was a very important day. France played _against_ Senegal  in the opening match of the World Cup. Soccer fans were very interested in watching the match on TV. To our great surprise, France was _beaten_.Today football has become very _popular_ in China after a _44-year_ wait. "China is in the World Cup for the first time, _so_ we should support them!" Said some people. In our school many students enjoy _playing_ it. My _classmates_ and I often go to the football field after class.This afternoon there was a _wonderful_ football match in our school. _Our_ team played against No.1 Middle School. _Though_ they were all very big and strong, it was a _draw_ game between the two teams with the result 0-0 last time. Today our school played much _better_.In the first half of the match _neither_ team kicked a goal, but in the second, Li Ming from our school kicked a goal. We won 1-0, at last. I’m so _pleased_. I can’t get to sleep tonight.
The computer is fast, and never makes a mistake, while people are too slow, and full of mistakes sometimes. That’s _what_ people often say when _they_ talk about computers. For over a quarter of a century, scientists have been _making_ better and better computers. Now a computer can _do_ a lot of _everyday_ jobs wonderfully. It is _widely_ used in factories, hospitals, post offices and airports. A computer can report, decide and control in almost _every_ field. Many computer scientists are thinking of _making_ the computer "think" like a man. With the help of a person, a computer can _draw_ pictures, write music, talk with people, play chess, recognize voices, translate languages and so on. Perhaps computers will one day really think and feel. Do you think the people will be afraid _when_ they find that the computer is too clever to listen to and serve the people? No, people will _make_ better use of the computers in _the_ future. Man is _always_ the master of the computer. The computer works only _with_ the help of man. It cannot take the place of man.
It was very cold that day. It was _snowing_ heavily and the ground was covered with _thick_ snow. The shepherd thought it was dangerous to climb up the hill and it was difficult for the sheep to find some _grass_ there. So he decided to stay in the _warm_ room. He put some hay so that the sheep could eat it when they were _hungry_. The dog, who felt cold outside, lay on the _soft_ hay and soon went to sleep.At noon the sheep wanted to eat the hay. They were _all_ afraid of the dog and _none_ could get close to it. At last the _strongest_ sheep came to the hay. Before he started to eat, the dog heard it and opened his eyes. He barked dog, the sheep began to talk _warn_."What a selfish dog!" said one of the sheep. "He cannot eat the hay, and yet refuses to _quickly_ those who can to eat!"
Mr. and Mrs. Harris had always spent their summer holidays in a small hotel at the seaside near their hometown. One year, however , Mr. Harris made a lot of _money_ in his business, _so_ they decided to go to a foreign country and stay at a really good _hotel_ .They flew to Rome, and _arrived_ at a 5-star hotel late in the evening. They thought they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that _small_ hotel where they had been used to stay in the past, no meals were served  _after_ seven in the evening. They were _surprised_ to be told that the hotel served dinner until ten."Then what are the times _of_ meals?" asked Mrs. Harris."Well, madam, we serve breakfast from seven to eleven, lunch from twelve to three, _tea_ from four to five, and dinner from six to ten.""But that hardly _leaves_ any time for us to see the city!" said Mrs. Harris.
Friends are very important in our everyday life. Everyone _needs_ friends. We all like to feel close to someone. _It_ is nice to have a friend to talk, laugh, and do things with. _Certainly_ , sometimes we need to be alone. We don’t always want people _around_ . But we would feel lonely if we _never_ had a friend.No two people are just the same . Friends _sometimes_ don’t get on well. That doesn’t mean that they no longer like each other. Most of the time they will make up  and become _friends_ again.Sometimes friends move away. Then we feel very _sad_ . We miss them very much, but we can _call_ them and write to them. And we can _make_ new friends. It is encouraging to find out how much we like new people when we get to know them.There’s more good news for people who have friends. They live _longer_ than people who don’t. Why? Friends can make us feel happy. _Being_ happy helps you stay well. Or it could be just done that someone cares. If some one cares about you, you take _better_ care of _yourself_ .

Perhaps the words may tell you some information and you have _tells_ it, but you can’t see any clear road _begin_ the answers.Maybe you _clear_ a kind of map of the main roads in maths _them_ you find your way. Explorewhat lies in maths, and _if_ to findthe main roads. They will _shows_ you to the answer. If you can find the "map", the maths problems will be easily worked out.

Several years ago I studied in a university in the biggest city in our country. It’s beautiful but it’s hot in _summer_. So I usually returned to my hometown when my _holiday_ began. It is not big, but it’s cool and quiet. I could _study_ in the daytime and have a good sleep at night.One day I had some _problems_ to solve. But I didn’t take the dictionaries home. My father told me Charlie, one of my 5, had a good library. I went to his house at once. We didn’t see each other after I _classmates_ middle school. At first he didn’t recognize me. He _finished_ me up and down. And then he called out, "Oh, dear! It’s you, Fred!"Of course we were _looked_ to meet each other again and talked a lot about our schoolmates and _happy_. Later on he showed me around his library. It wasn’t big but there were a lot of nice books in it. And the dictionaries I _teachers_ were in them too. At last I said, "11 you lend some dictionaries to me, please?""I’m sorry I don’t lend any books to 12," said the young man."Are you afraid I’ll looked for them?""No, I’m not. I’m afraid you won’t _Can_ them to me. Look! All the books are not 15, but borrowed!"
Farley worked for the Canadian government. One day, he was _told_ to learn more about wolves. Do wolves kill lots of caribou? Do they kill people?They gave him lots of food and clothes and guns. Then they put him on a plane and took him to a far place. The plane put him down and went away. There were no houses or people in this place. But there were lots of animals and lots of wolves.People tell terrible stories about wolves. They say wolves like to kill and eat people. Farley remembered these stories, and he was _afraid_. He had his gun with him4.Then one day, he saw a group of wolves. There was a mother wolf with four baby wolves. A father wolf and another young wolf lived with them.Farley watched these wolves every day. The mother was a very all the time mother. She gave milk to her babies. She gave them lessons about life. They learned how to _good_ food. The father wolf got food for the mother. The young wolf _get_ the children. They were a nice, happy family—wolf family! Farley did not need his played with any more. In a short time, he got on well with the family. Farley watched them for five months. He learned that many stories about the wolves were _gun_. Wolves do not eat people, and they do not eat many large animals. And he also learned bad things about men. It was men who killed many caribou and wolves.Later, Farley wrote a book about wolves. He wanted people to not true them and not to kill them.
Mr. Wang teaches English in a middle school. He likes his work very much. He wanted to be a teacher even when he was a young boy.There are six classes in a school day at Mr. Wang's middle school. Mr. Wang teachers five of these six classes. _At_ his "free" hour from 2 to 3 in the afternoon, Mr. Wang has to meet with parents, check students' homework and take care of many other things. So Mr. Wang works hard from the moment he gets to school early in the morning until he leaves for home late in the afternoon, and his "free" hour is not free at all.In his English lesson, Mr. Wang sometimes teaches poems . He likes poems very much, and he likes Li Bai’s poems _best_ of all.In his fifth class today, Mr. Wang taught a poem. He wrote the poem on the blackboard and read it. As soon as he finished _reading_ the poem, the students began to ask questions. He answered all the questions. Then he asked his students to talk about the poem. _No_ one wanted to stop when the bell rang.8 home, Mr. Wang thought about the fifth class. He was happy about what he did as a teacher. Every one of his students On his way the poem. When they started to talk, they forgot about the time. He did not have to make them _liked_ . He only had to answer their questions and help them understand the poem.
Many animals use some kinds of "language". They use signals and the signals have meanings. For example, _when_ a bee has found some food, it goes back to its home. _It_ is difficult for a bee to tell the other bees where the food is speaking to them, but it can do a little dancing. This tells the bees where the food is and how far away it is.Some animals show _how_ they feel by making sounds. It is not difficult to tell if a dog is angry because it barks. Birds make several different sounds and _each_ has its meaning. Sometimes we humans make sounds in the same way. We make sounds like "Oh" to _show_ how we feel about _something_ or we _drop_ something on our feet.We humans have languages. We have words. These words have meaning of things, action, feeling or ideas. We are able to _give_ each other information, to tell other people _what_ we think or we feel. By writing down words, we can remember what has happened or _send_ messages to people far away.Languages, like people, live and die. If a language is not used by people, it is called a dead language. This language cannot live and grow because no one speaks it.A living language, of course, is often spoken by people today. It grows and changes with time. New words are created, and some old words have _new_ meanings.
It’s never easy to admit you are in the wrong. We all _need_ to know the art of apology. Think how often you’ve done wrong. Then count how many _times_ you’ve expressed clearly you were _sorry_. You can’t go to bed with an easy mind if you do _nothing_ about it.A doctor friend, Mr. Lied, told me about a man who came to him with different kinds of signs: headaches, heart _trouble_ and insomnia . Then and there the _After_ doctor _wrong_ the man write to his brother and _worrying_ his money. As soon as the _clever_ was put into the post box, the man suddenly cried. "Thank you," he said to the doctor, "I think I’ve got _let_."An apology can not only save a broken relationship but also make it _returned_. If you can think of someone who should be _letter_ an apology from you. Do something about it right now.
Mr. and Mrs. king have lived in our town for nearly twenty years. They have a bookshop by the bus station. They’re _polite_ to everybody and have a lot of friends. They often _help_ the poor students and sell them some books cheaply. So there’re many young men in their shop. Of course people _like_ them and their friends often call on  them and talk with them. We can always hear their rooms are full of _laugh_ and quarrel.It was a Friday evening. Mr. and Mrs. King were going to have a picnic on the island the next _morning_. It was a little far from our town. So they had to get up earlier than usual to catch a six o’clock train. After _supper_ a few friends came to see them while they were cooking some _food_ and drinks for the picnic. Mr. king and his wife had to stop to receive them. They talked a lot and few of them looked at the _clock_ on the wall. Mr. and Mrs. King were anxious  but they couldn’t tell the visitors about it. The woman thought for a few _minutes_ and had an idea. She said to her 13, "Oh, it’s eleven o’clock! You’d better stop talking, dear! Our guests are anxious to 14!Mr. king heard this and stood up and said _husband_ to the visitors and they left soon.
Martin Henfield talks about some of his experience inside a double sleeping bag my mother made for us.At school our classmates 5us Henfield One and Henfield Two, so people _in_ even see our difference according to our initials because _worse_ of us were M.O. It was only when I went to all the other boys and began to have my own friends that I started to feel my own freedom of identity.Before I went to college, during my secondary school 9, I _night_ to a job on a building site. My twin brother, Mike Henfield, didn’t work. One day I asked my boss, "Can I have a week 11?" "Certainly," he said, "but you won’t have the job when you _called_ back." I didn’t want to _couldn’t_ the job. So on Monday morning, Mike went there in my 14, jacket and hat and he worked for me for one week _both_ of them knew the difference.
Have you ever seen the advertisement: Learn a foreign language in six weeks, _or_ give your money back? Of course, it _never_ happens quite like that. The only language _easy_ to learn is the mother language. And think how much practice is needed for that. Before the Second World War people usually learned a foreign language to study the literature of the country. Now most people want to _speak_ a foreign language. Every year millions of people start learning _it_ .How do they do it? Some people try at home _with_ books and tapes, others go to evening classes or watch TV programs. _If_ they use the language only 2 or 3 times a week, learning it will _take_ a long time, like language learning at school. A few people try to learn a language fast by studying for 6 or _more_ hours a day. It's much easier to learn the language in the country where it is spoken . But most people are _unable_ to do this, and many people don't have to do so. Machines and good books will be very _helpful_ , but they can not do the students' work. _whether_ the language is learned quickly or slowly, it is hard work.
I have tried many ways to be _ill_ . I don’t wear a sweater when I _should_ , and two days ago I walked in the _rain_ without my shoes. But so far nothing has happened . Debbie once told me about a boy in her class who liked . being away from school. He would rub until it went _up_ to 39℃. Then he’d put it in his mouth and his mother would think he was . really ill.This morning I tried doing that but it _never_ went above 35℃ and I rubbed it for ten _minutes_ . So I held the thermometer next to the light on my desk and it went up to 40℃. I thought I’d put it in my mouth and walk downstairs like that. _Then_ my mother would take it out and she would be . worried when she saw that I was rather ill.The only trouble was I didn’t know the thermometer would be so _hot_ , As soon as I put it into my mouth I burnt my tongue the thermometer out. It fell _on_ the floor but it wasn’t broken .
Do you know Eskimos ? Let me tell you something about their _life_ .The Eskimos live near the North Pole . There are only two _seasons_ there, winter and summer, There are no spring _or_ autumn there. The winter nights are _long_ . You can't _see_ the sun for more than two months, even at noon. The summer days are long. For more than two months, the sun never goes down and there is no night.The Eskimos have _warm_ clothes. They make their clothes from the skin of animals. From these skins they make coats, caps and _shoes_ .Near the North Pole trees can't grow, for it is too _cold_ there. The Eskimos have to make their houses from skins, snow or stones . When they go out in storm and can't get back home, they make house of snow. They _leave_ these snow houses when the storm is _over_ .Life is _hard_ for the Eskimos, but they still like to live there.
Life in the twenty-first century will be very _different_ . Many changes will take place, but _what_ will the changes be.The population is growing _fast_ . There will be many _people_ in the world and most of them will live _longer_ than people in the twentieth century.Computers will be much smaller and more useful and there will be at least one in every _home_ . And _computer_ studies will be one of the important subjects in school then.People will work fewer hours and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and travelling. _Travelling_ will be much easier and cheaper. And many more people will go to _other_ countries for holidays.There will be changes in our _food_ , too. Maybe no one will eat meat every day, instead, they eat more fruit and vegetables. Maybe people will be _.healthier_ . Work in the future will be different, too. _Dangerous_ and hard work can be done by robots. Because of this, many people will not have enough work to do .This will be a problem.
Many people go to school for an education. _They_ learn languages, history, geography, physics, chemistry and maths. Others go to school to learn a skill so that they can _make_ a living. School _education_ is very important and useful. Yet no one can learn everything from school. A teacher, no matter how much he _knows_ , can not teach his students everything they _want_ to know. The teacher's job is to show his students how to read and how to _think_ . So much more is to be learned _outside_ school by the students themselves.It is always more important to know how to study by _oneself_ than to memorize. It is _actually_ quite easy to learn a _certain_ fact in history or a formula in mathematics. But it is very difficult to use a formula in _working_ out a maths problem. Great scientists, such as Einstein, Newton and Galileo, didn't learn many things from school. But they were all so _successful_ that they invented so many things for mankind.The _reason_ for their success is that they knew how to study. They read books that were not _taught_ at school. They worked hard all their lives, wasting not a single moment. They would ask many questions as they read and they did thousands of _jobs_ .
Many people think that Americans _love_ their cars almost more than anything else. When _young_ people are fourteen years old, they want to have their _own_ cars. They don’t ask for a car from their _parents_. So many of them work in _free_ time during their last year of high school to buy a car. Learning to _drive_  and getting a driver’s license may be one of the most exciting things in a young person’s life.Some people almost _never_  go to a doctor when they are ill. But they will _take_ their cars to a garage as soon as they think there is a _problem_ . On Saturdays or Sundays some people may _spend_ most of their time washing and repairing their cars.
About 70,000,000 Americans are trying to lose weight. That is almost 1 out of every 3 people in the United States. Some people eat _less_ food and they hardly have any fats or sweets. Others do running, exercise with machines, take medicines, or even have operations. _So_ you can see losing weight is _hard_ work, and it will also cost a lot of money. But _why_ do so many people in the United States want to lose weight?Many people in the United States worry about their look of the body. For many people, looking nice also means to be _thin_ . Other people worry about their health as many doctors _say_ overweight is not good.Most people want to find an _easier_ way to take off fat, and books of this kind are very popular. These books tell people how to lose weight. Each year a lot of new books like these are _written_ . Each one says it can easily help people take fat away.Losing weight can be _expensive_ . Some overweight people go to health centres, like La Costa in California. Men and women _pay_ several hundred dollars a day at these health centres. People live there for one week or two, _taking_ exercise, eating different foods. Meals there may be just a little. All these work for losing weight. _After_ 4 days on the programme, one woman called Mrs. Warren lost 5 pounds . At $ 400 a day, she spent $ 320 to lose each pound. But she said she was still _glad_ to do so.Health centres, books, medicines, operations, running and exercise machines all _need_ a lot of money. So in the United States, losing weight may mean losing _money_ too.
When the boys _reached_ home, it was eleven o’clock. It was dark _outside_ but there was a light inside their home and the door was open . They could see a man inside."Who can _it_ be? " Said Peter. "Mother and Father have gone to do some _shopping_ . They won’t be home _until_ eight o’clock. "When the man saw Peter, he looked _frightened_ . Then he smiled and said. "Come in! You don’t know me, but I’m a friend of your father’s ." The man didn’t see John.Peter went inside and began _talking_ to the man but John didn’t. He quickly but quietly ran off. He soon found a policeman and brought him back to their home. The man was _still_ there, but when he saw the policeman, he tried to run off. The policeman caught him _by_ the arm. Just then the boys’ parents _returned_ ."Is the man your friend?" The policeman asked Mr. Turner ."No, he is a thief. He wanted to steal my money. _It’s_ nice of you to catch him."
It is common in English to ask people about their holidays. In the West, many _families_ go away on holiday during the summer months, _and_ so it is very usual to _ask_ about this. If the holiday has not _yet_ taken place, then their holiday plans _need_ be talked about. And if it is already over, then where _they_ went, whether they _liked_ it and so on can be discussed. Similar questions are asked _before_ some public holidays.9 living and working in China often _Foreigners_ opportunities for travel, either at weekends or during _have_ holidays, so such kind of _their_ lead to fruitful discussions. They may be _Questions_ to know if they have chosen the _interested_ places, especially those a little less _right_ ones.
Dear George,Half a year has gone by _since_ we said goodbye to each other at the Kaitak airport  . Except for a few hurriedly written notes you have not written to any of your old _classmates_ any letters _for_ a few days. We are studying _in_ a foreign university, but know _nothing_ of what is going on about you.Last night, John, Tom and I _made_ a happy reunion  in dinner. It was all like the old high school _days_ except that you were not in this get together. _Suddenly_ we all felt . missing you. We then began to talk about you and wondered what you were doing at that moment. At last we _drank_ to your health.What kind of life you are living in London? Is your school-work keeping you _busy_ ? And there are a thousand things we want to _know_ . Please tell us.My _best_ regards  , also John’s and Tom’s.Your old friend,Tonny
One will feel happy when others flatter him in his face. It is said that the best way of flattering someone is to give him a "top hat" to wear .A student was going to leave the capital to become an official in a city far away. Before he started, he came to say good bye to his teacher."It is not an easy job to be a good official." his teacher said. " you must be strict _with_ yourself and never be careless."Don’t worry about me, sir." The student answered. "I have already _prepared_ one hundred top hats, which will _make_ those people quite happy.""But we are really gentlemen! _How_ could a real gentleman do such a thing" his teacher was a bit _angry_ . "Never forget _what_ I taught you in class!"" _You_ are always right, sir I also hate such things. But, sir, _almost_ no one really gentleman like you can be seen in the world now." said the student. It seemed that he had to do so.After hearing this , the teacher was _pleased_ . "What you said is true!""I have sent out one top hat already. Now I have ninety-nine _left_ ." the student said to his friend later on when he asked the student what he had talked with the teacher about.
"It’s over! Thank goodness!" school was _over_ and I was tired. I _sat_ at the front of the school bus.Janie, the driver, tries to _break_ the uncomfortable atmosphere by striking the match of talks. I try to listen _politely_ , but usually I am too _busy_ thinking about my day. On this day, however, her talk was worth listening to ."My father’s ill ," she said to no one in particular. I could see worry in her _eyes_ . I had never seen her like this before. She always meets students _with_ a smile.With a sudden change of interest, I asked, " what’s wrong with him?"With her eyes wet and her voice _unusual_ , she answered, "Heart trouble." Her eyes lowered as she continued. "I’ve already _lost_ my mum, so I don’t think I can stand losing him." I couldn’t answer. My heart ached for her.I sat on the _seat_ thinking of the great pain my own mother was thrown into when her father died. I saw how hard it was, and still is, for her. I wouldn’t want to anyone to go through that.Suddenly I realized Janie wasn’t only a bus _driver_ , that was just her job. She had a whole world of family and cares _too_ .I suddenly _felt_ very selfish. I paid no attention to Janie because she was a bus driver. I had judged her by her job and brushed her off as unimportant.I shouldn’t have been so selfish and self-centered. _Understanding_ people is an art.
The women’s college had a very small car park, and because several of the teachers and students, and many of the students’ boyfriends, had cars, it was often _difficult_ to find a place to park. The head of the college, Miss Baker, had a _place_ in the car park for her own small car. There were white _lines_ around it, and it had a small blackboard saying, "Only for Head of College."One evening when Miss Baker got _back_ to the college a few minutes before the time all the students should be in, she _found_ another car in her parking place. There were two _people_ in it, one of her girl students and a young man. Miss Baker _knew_ that the young man would have to leave soon, _so_ she decided to ask him to move his car a bit, for her to park her car in the place for the night _before_ going to bed.Because the young man’s car was _next_ to the railing, Miss Baker had to drive up beside it on the other _side_ , where the girl was sitting. She came up on this side, _opened_ her own window and tapped her horn lightly. The girl was having her head on the _man’s_ shoulder. She looked round in _surprise_ . She was even more surprised when she _heard_ Miss Baker say, "Excuse me, but may I change places with you?"
Long ago there was a poor farmer called Fred. Fred and his wife, Doris lived _happily_ together in their small old house. One winter night, the Luck Fairy  visited them ."Fred, you’re a _good_ farmer. I’d like to give you a wish," said the Luck Fairy."A wish?" Said Fred.Fred and Doris smiled at each other. Then Fred said, " Thank you , Luck Fairy. We’re very _healthy_ and happy."" _Though_ we’re old, we still work in the field every day," said Doris."You wok very hard but you _make_ very little money. Would you like some gold coins " asked the Luck Fairy."Oh no , my dear Luck Fairy. We’re poor. But we have _enough_ food to eat." Replied Fred."You can use the gold coin to buy some clothes. The winter here is very cold," said Luck Fairy."Though we haven’t got _many_ clothes, we’ve got enough," said Doris."Well, what about a nice new house?" Asked Luck Fairy."Thank you, but I _love_ my small old house very much. I’ve lived here since I was born. I don’t _need_ a new house," said Fred."You’re quite different from other people. I like you very much," said the Luck Fairy. "I wish you happiness and Luck forever." Then the Luck Fairy _disappeared_ and never came back.
A thousand years ago, Hong Kong was covered by a thick forest. As more and more people came to _live_ in Hong Kong, these trees were cut down and burnt. Now there is _no_ forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods.Elephants, tigers and many _other_ animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the _animals_ began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and _kept_ pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed _fire_ to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. _So_ did most of the wolves and tigers. Monkeys and many other animals soon _died_ in the same way.You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong _except_ in the zoos. There are still about _living_ different animals _with_ there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong’s animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals _high_ a rich brown coat and a white patch wild animals.

I’m glad it’s Sunday again. I can stay in bed as long as I like, drinking tea and _reading_ those thick newspapers that are brought _by_ the newsboy through the letterbox at 8:30. In this way, I can catch up with all the _things_ I haven’t got time to read during my work time.When I have read the papers, I then prepare my bath. The Sunday morning bath is the most pleasant of the week. There's no need to hurry because there’s no bus to _catch_ and my friends are told not to call me up before noon on Sundays, so there is no danger of being troubled by the telephone.9 spend the afternoon after lunch is always a bit of problem. In summer I can go to the park and sit in a chair How to boys playing football, while in winter I sit in front of the fire and _watching_ when reading a book, sometimes I turn on the television and sleep through an old film.Then there’s the fall asleep ahead of me.

Many people think the _more_ time is spent, the more work will be done. So students have to spend the whole _day_ doing school work except the three meals.Modern students have many _interests_ . They love sports, computers and music. A _two-day_ holiday can get them away from too much school work, and they can do _what_ they like. But still teachers do not think about it. Because students have too much homework, they have no time to _enjoy_ themselves. Students are really tired _of_ their weekend homework. So they don’t do it _until_ Sunday night. And there is not enough time to finish the homework _carefully_ . The poor weekend homework usually makes teachers _angry_ .Things always get _worse_ without right ideas. Too much school work makes students lose interest in learning. It’s also bad for their _health_ . A horse runs faster after a _rest_ . But for students only rest is not enough. So such a condition  should be _changed_ to give students both _pleasure_ and knowledge.

The old man was always worried about food and clothes.And on a winter night he went out alone when Sarya was asleep. The next morning he was _found_ dead in a cold lake. And his worn-out coat was _hung_ in a tree not far away. Sarya was so _sad_ that she nearly took her own life.Things got worse and worse after that. She always lived in hunger and cold. She had hoped that the government could help her but she _failed_ .It was a cold windy night. The old woman couldn't _fall_ asleep at all. She had to get up. She decided to write a letter to God, so she could buy some food for herself. When she _help_ writing it, she found she had no _finished_ . She had to put the _stamp_ at a crossing. _letter_ the next morning a policeman found the letter. He read it to his comrades.They were all so _Luckily_ that they gathered some rubles and sent them to the poor old woman.At first Granny Sarya was happy. But after she _moved_ the money, she became _counted_ and said, "I'm told that all things that are touched by the policeman will be only a half left!"
Mr. Robinson had to travel somewhere on business, and as he was in a hurry, he decided to go by _air_ . He liked sitting _beside_ a window when he was flying, so he got onto the plane, he looked for a window seat. He _found_ all of them taken except one. There was a young man _seated_ beside it, and Robinson was surprised that he had not taken the one by the window. Anyhow, he went towards it.When he _reached_ it, however, he saw that there was a notice on it, written _in_ large letters, _saying_ "This seat is kept for proper balance. Thank you." Mr. Robinson had never seen such a notice before, but he thought the plane must be carrying something particularly heavy in its room _which_ made it necessary to have the passengers properly balance. So he walked on and found _another_ empty seat, not beside the window to sit on .Two or three other people _tried_ to sit in the window seat next to the young man, but they also read the notice and went on. Then when the plane was nearly _full_ a very beautiful girl _stepped_ into the plane. The young man, who was watching the passengers coming in, _quickly_ took the notice _off_ the seat beside him, and by this means succeeded in having a pretty companion during the whole trip.
Food is very important. Everyone needs to _eat_ well if he or she wants to have a strong body. Our minds also need a kind of food. This kind of food is _knowledge_. We begin to get knowledge even _when_ we are very young. Small children are _interested_ in everything around them. They learn _something_ while they are watching and listening. When they are getting older, they begin to _read_ story books, science books…, anything they like. When they find something new, they love to ask questions and _try_ to find out answers. What is the best _way_ to get knowledge? If we learn by ourselves, we will get the most knowledge. If we are _always_ getting answers from others and do not ask why, we will never learn well. When we study in the right way, we will learn more and understand better.
Someone says, "Time is money." But I think time is even more important than money. Why? Because when money is spent, we can get it back. However, when time is _gone_ it’ll never _return_ . That’s _why_ we mustn’t waste time.It goes without saying that the _time_ is usually limited. Even a second is very important. We should make full use of our time to do _something_ useful.But it is a pity that there are a lot of people who do not know the importance of time. They spent their limited time smoking, drinking and _playing_ . They do not know that wasting time means wasting part of their own _life_ .In a word, we should save time. We shouldn’t _leave_ today’s work for tomorrow. Remember we have no time to _lose_ .
