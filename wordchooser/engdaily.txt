The honey bee is a very unusual kind of insect. _Unlike_ other insects which live alone, the honey bee lives as a _member_ of a community. These bees live _together_ in what is known as a bee colony.The head of the colony is called the queen bee. She is larger than the _rest_ of the bees. Her main task _in_ the colony is to lay eggs. Most of the _other_ bees are the worker bees. These bees _collect_ nectar and pollen from flowers. The nectar _that_ is carried by the worker bees is deposited on the hive and then converted _into_ honey. The worker bees also help look _after_ the young bees. as soon as the eggs are _hatched_ , the worker bees feed the young bees _with_ pollen and nectar. The third type of bee found in the colony is the drone or _male_ bee. The main task of _such_ a bee is to mate with a new queen.The queen bee has a life _span_ of about three years. _During_ this period, she would have _laid_ more than half a million eggs. _When_ the queen bee is dying, a new queen would be groomed. This new queen would eventually take _over_ the 'duties' of the old queen when the _latter_ dies.
"Would you like to buy a box of matchsticks, mister ?" the little girl asked. The man _whom_ she approached did not even _stop_ to answer her. He shuffled _away_ in his great coat, eager to get home _to_ his cosy fireplace.The girl was shivering _in_ the cold. It had been _snowing_ continuously for the past two days. The girl's shoes, _which_ were already thin were thoroughly soaked. Yet, her sweet, angelic _face_ did not lose _its_ innocent smile. It only made her _look_ more pathetic when she knitted her brows sometimes. Her feet _were_ sore with painful chilblains.Someone shouted, "Watch _out_ , girl !"It was too _late_ ! The coach was going too fast and the _driver_ had not seen her earlier. There was barely enough _time_ for the little girl to take a step back. In her hurry to get to _safety_ , the basket of matchsticks fell _onto_ the snow.She _picked_ them up, wet and dirty from a puddle of melted snow. The matchstick couldn't be used now. as she began to make her way _home_ , she realised that she had lost _one_ of her shoes in the snow.
Squirrels are the most resourceful animal in the world. They have the knack of saving up for _rainy_ days.Autumn can be very entertaining _for_ them. That is the time _when_ they begin the great harvest collection _for_ their winter store. You can see them scampering here and _there_ , collecting nuts of _all_ sorts. Walnuts, beechnuts, chestnuts, dried berries ... They are not fussy. Relentlessly, they run _from_ their storage point, usually a tree hollow, _to_ the vast amount of wild nuts to be _found_ in the forest.These beautiful animals are house-proud. They take great _pains_ to ensure that their nest is secure and _warm_ enough to tide them _over_ the harsh winter. You will see them busily _collecting_ soft pieces of bark, wood and leaves to line _their_ nests.After all their scavenging _is_ done, and when the first, cold hard frost arrives, they will seal _themselves_ inside their nests for the _duration_ of the cold spell. There, they will hibernate _till_ it is warm enough to bring out their stored food. Ah, but then again, they are the _most_ forgetful little animals, and it is not _unusual_ to see squirrels searching desperately for their hoards.
After_ a while, however, Millie managed to persuade her brothers to take her _along_ . When they reached the fishing pond, the two brothers wandered _off by themselves."We have a secret spot _where_ the fishes are really biting," they told her. "But you can't _come_ along because we promised the other guys we wouldn't show anyone _else_ the place."The two boys left Millie on her _own_ . They sat at their secret spot _for_ the next few hours but did not catch anything. They decided to call it a day _and_ went to look for Millie."I bet she hasn't caught anything _either_ ," said her other brother, Eric.When_ the boys found Millie, they saw something that made them _open_ their eyes wide with amazement. Millie had _caught four large fishes!"I ... I take _back_ what I said about you this morning," Derek said when he finally found his voice.Millie shrugged her _shoulders_ , smiled and said nothing. On their way _home_ by bus, the two brothers did not notice that they had passed a small shop with a sign which _read_ : Fresh fish for sale - cheap prices.
Samburu National Reserve is _located_ in an entirely different terrain. Lying on the edge _of_ the great desert of northern Kenya, _it_ is a vast stretch of scrubland _inhabited_ by elephants and leopards.Mount Kenya is also a good _place_ to observe animals and plants. _If_ one drives up the flank of the mountain, _one_ would pass _through_ great bamboo jungles and mountain forests _all_ the way up to the alpine zone. With its giant plants _and_ foliage, this is a place _which_ botanists would love.
Grass snakes eat insects and small animals _like_ frogs and chicks. They are good for the garden as they keep _away_ pests like rats and gophers.The more poisonous varieties _of_ snakes are the python and viper. _These_ snakes are seldom found in gardens. Instead, these snakes _live_ in forests or in dense vegetation _such_ as swampland. They do not actively seek _out_ victims, but _will_ defend themselves against potential enemies _and_ intruders. If the snake senses _someone_ coming, it would rather glide noiselessly away _than_ confront the person.Contrary to popular belief, snakes do not sting _with_ their tongue. They bite with two fangs _which_ point backwards. The snake's tongue, which continuously flicks _in_ and out, is actually its 'fingers'. Its tongue _consists_ of nerve endings which helps the snake feel the food before _eating_ it.
In private life, Einstein was a quiet man who liked to _take_ long walks, sail and _play_ the violin. He was also deeply concerned with the social consequences _of_ science. He urged nations to _live_ in peace and refused an offer to _become_ Israel's president. Just before World War II broke _out_ , Einstein cautioned President Franklin Roosevelt _about_ the likelihood of the invention of _the_ atomic bomb, and the revolutionary effects it would _have_ on the world.Einstein died in 1955. Today, he is still _remembered_ as a humanitarian as _well_ as a scientist.
Few other adults ever _play_ such important part in a child's life as _do_ parents. You _may_ not have liked Mrs Lim, your form teacher, but she was _not_ the ultimate authority during your childhood _years_ . Teachers may point _out_ our mistakes in class, but they do not _have_ the continuous authority _over_ us that our parents do. What is _more_ important is that the authority of the teacher _ends_ when school is over _for_ the day.
"Hydrogen sulphide gas, actually. Mind _your_ camera!" Alan warned, seizing her arm and drawing her _away_ as she ventured too _close_ to the hissing steam. "That vapour _contains_ hydrochloric acid, among _among_ things." Ganying clutched her camera tightly.They crouched _down_ beside one of the largest mud pools. It was two metres across, with a metre-high rim formed _by_ the splattering mud. The liquid mud slurped noisily as large bubbles of gas burst.Ganying quickly took _out_ her camera. Ganying got two marvellous shots. _One_ was of a metre-wide bubble rising into a dome. The other was _of_ a circle of droplets hanging in mid-air. She walked _on_  _towards a cream-coloured cone_ from _which steam was billowing like a mini-volcano. The smell was terrible, and the mouth of the cone was stained yellow _by the powdered sulphur.
Michelangelo was commissioned to paint the famous Sistine Chapel walls and frescoes. This, he performed _to_ the best of his capabilities. He created a beautiful biblical presentation _of_ the birth of humanity. This _consists_ of the six days of creation and the making of Adam and Eve.Michelangelo was _also_ a sculptor. He captured the beauty of the human form _in_ his sculptures, 'David and the Slaves', 'Moses' and 'Madonna and Child'. The splendour of his art can still be viewed in Rome _today_ .Towards the last years of his _life_ , Michelangelo worked even harder, _with_ seemingly tireless energy. He developed a distinctive style of his _own_ and devoted more effort to pictures and architecture. However, he became very depressed _as_ his last days approached and _this_ was evident in his last few pieces of _work_ , 'Judgment Day' and 'Conversion of St. Paul'. They portrayed physical aggression, implying _the_ unnecessity of suffering in this world.
On the coast of Brazil, the cities _are_ overcrowded. Men holding titles _to_ the jungle land are eagerly waiting to _claim_ their plot of land. Only the Indians _stand_ in their way. These title holders excuse _themselves_ by saying that to preserve a way of life _so_ unsuited to the modern world, it is _necessary_ to put the Indians in a sort of human zoo. Thus, developers have entered the jungle bringing along _with_ them diseases, drinks, money and _other_ influences that will tempt the simple jungle people _and_ destroy their way of life.
During_ the Chinese New Year season, stalls selling all kinds of goods, lined the street in Chinatown. Goods _ranged_ from food to clothes, flowers to household provisions. These stalls were _opened_ late into the night and hundreds of _people_ would brave the crowd to do their new year _shopping_ . It was a hot and noisy affair, but one could feel the festive _mood_ in the air amidst the crowd. The _most_ exciting day for shopping was New Year's Eve _itself_ . As midnight approached, _prices_ of goods were drastically reduced. This was because the stallholders wanted to sell _off_ their goods quickly so that they could go home to _celebrate_ the new year. It was also at _this_ time that the crowd was _at its thickest.In the early 1980s, the Urban Renewal Authority decided that the roadside stalls _had_ to go for hygiene _reasons_ . Thus, shopping _under_ the stars in Chinatown has become a mere memory for many people.
Charles Dickens _himself_ had to work in a factory, washing bottles and sticking labels _onto_ bottles. People _looked_ down on his family and him. Dickens was unhappy and ashamed _of_ this period of his _life_ . His loss of dignity was later reflected _in_ his book, 'David Copperfield', in which the main _character_ also worked in a factory washing bottles.The family returned to a more normal life after Dickens's father _received_ a financial aid. Dickens was _sent_ to a school. School discipline in those days _was_ very harsh. Severe punishments were meted _out_ freely for slight misdemeanours. Once _again_ , Dickens suffered.Throughout _their_ trials, Dickens and his family members remained close knit and supportive of _one_ another. Dickens knew that _without_ them he would probably have been a thief and a beggar _like_ Oliver in his book 'Oliver Twist'.Among Dickens's greatest works _were_ 'Great Expectations' , 'Oliver Twist', 'The Old Curiosity Shop' and 'David Copperfield'.
The Red Indians were waiting for the arrival _of_ the bison. The beasts, _which_ come only once a year, are a good _source_ of meat and hide. The Red Indians needed these to _survive_ the cold, bitter winter.Tikki, the young boy, was chosen to look _out_ for the herd's arrival. Every day, he would run to the _top_ of the hill to see if he could spot them _on_ the vast horizon.One night, _while_ he was sleeping, the ground shook violently and his bag of arrows fell _off_ from its hook on the wall. Tikki rushed out of his wigwam and _felt_ a strong gust of wind and dust gush _past_ him. Shouting excitedly, he ran to the _other_ wigwams and woke everyone _up_ . A big fire was immediately _built_ and the Red Indians danced _round_ it, giving praises to their God _who_ had, at last, sent _them_ their food and clothing of animal hide. The next morning, _all_ the warrior were assigned to hunt _down_ the beasts which were grazing _near_ the river.
Yet, donkeys that live _in_ the wild are fine-looking and well-built creatures. They are sociable and _have_ an average lifespan longer than _that_ of horses. Wild donkeys can _run_ even faster than horses. They are _more_ patient than horses, more evenly-tempered and more willing to _do_ tedious jobs that involve going _to_ and from the _same_ place.The donkey was the first animal domesticated by _man_ as a beast of burden. In ancient _times_ , the donkey was used frequently as a _means_ of transport in Palestine. Perhaps the best honor _given_ to this humble animal is the _fact_ that Jesus _entered_ Jerusalem riding on a donkey.
The serfs usually lived _in_ cramped and unhygienic environments in the lords' castles. _Conditions_ were so bad that diseases _spread_ very quickly. Black rats, which bred very _quickly_ in such environments, ran around, carrying diseases _on_ them. When _these_ infected rats bit other rats _or_ human beings, the diseases _were_ transmitted to their victims. This became _so_ widespread that many villages were wiped out and about one million people _died_ in just two years because of the Black Death.Because_ of this, fewer and fewer people were _willing_ to work or to _live_ in the lords' manors. They demanded to be _allowed_ to rent their own land out _of their pay. This was the beginning of the abolition of the feudal system in Europe.
Today, social change has developed in such a way _that_ most people do not want to draw clear _lines_ between the rich and the _poor_ . This is known as democratization. The trend has spread to _the_ area of dressing, so that fashion is no longer a rigid indication _of_ a person's social position. It is _true_ , however, that certain expensive brands of clothes are _affordable_ only to the rich. People who _buy_ these exclusive brands are immediately recognized _as_ the more well-to-do among us.
Ironically, in the silk factory, it is _during_ this stage that the silk workers harvest _silk_ . The cocoon is heated to _kill_ the pupa inside it. The threads from several cocoons are then twisted _together_ to make one strong silk thread. The threads _may_ be dyed or used in its raw form to _make_ material for clothes. Perhaps now you may begin to _understand_ why articles made of silk can be _so_ expensive. Can you _imagine_ how many silkworms have to be killed in the heating process _just_ to make one silk blouse?
Although_ most bacteria do not contain chlorophyll, some of them can _make_ their own organic food from simple inorganic materials. They do not, _however_ , use light energy for this _purpose_ . Others get ready-made food _from_ dead plants and animals. Still _others_ are parasites. Parasites are able to enter _other_ living organisms and take _food_ from them. In doing so, they often _cause_ diseases or the death _of their hosts.
There were many stalls set _up_ along the five-foot way in front of the shop-houses. Rough canvases had been spread _on_ the ground, and _all_ the hawkers' wares were neatly piled upon _them_ . There were interesting items of all _kinds_ : clay figurines, scarves, handcrafted silverware, hats and many other things of interest.The people at the 'pasar malam' were _as_ varied as the goods that were on _sale_ . However, it was crystal clear that they were all there to _seek_ bargains. There was much haggling _over_ the prices of the goods. Everyone _was_ swept into the light, gay mood that pervaded the bazaar. The bright lights and cheerful banter _between_ customers and hawkers created a most entertaining _atmosphere_ .I bought several unusual _pieces_ of pottery for my parents and a huge stuffed bear for my sister. For _myself_ , I bought a delightful train set which, _although_ old-fashioned, was _in_ perfect running order. It was also very cheap!
Before Nobel died, he gave away his _money_ to establish a fund. Every year, the interest _from_ this fund was to be given to the _person_ who has done the most good _for_ mankind in that year. There are awards in the _fields_ of physics, chemistry, medicine and literature. The _most_ prestigious award, however, is _the_ Nobel Peace Prize. This is given to the person _who_ has done the most to _promote_ world peace. _One_ of the most famous persons to have _received_ the award was Mahatma Gandhi of India.
I had to study late into the _night_ to prepare for my examination. Alone _in_ the hall when everyone else was _asleep_ , a very slight noise frightened me. I imagined that there was _someone_ behind me while I was memorizing mathematical formulae. Every _time_ the curtains fluttered in the wind, my heart missed a _beat_ . When my neighbour's dog barked, I broke _out_ in goose bumps because dogs are supposed to be _able_ to see spirits that are invisible to the human _eye_ . Finally, I decided to read _aloud_ so that at least I had the company of my _voice_ . Unfortunately, I soon _felt_ thirsty from it. Still I _dared_ not go to the kitchen to get a drink in _case_ a werewolf was waiting there to pounce _on_ me.After the examination, I had plenty of time on my _hands_ . What do you _think_ I did? I read everything _from_ comics to science-fiction, but I did not read a _single_ horror story this time.
However, there are still _areas_ in our educational system which need improvement. _There_ is a need for quality education. We spend so _much_ time memorizing as many facts _as_ physically possible and then regurgitating _them_ during our examinations. There is _no_ space for experimentation nor _for_ the cultivation of genuine interest. _What_ is required is a real understanding and appreciation of a subject, _not_ merely scoring high marks.Until we learn to discard our inhibitions _about_ the freedom of creativity, we will _never_ achieve independence of thought.
Instead_ of hiring maids to look after their children, many parents would prefer to _leave_ their children at these centers. This is _because_ children at these centers would be well supervised; they would have a proper schedule for work and _play_ . If they require private tuition, children may _even_ arrange for their tutors to come to the community centers. The centers would also have the comforts _of_ a home. The center at Hougang, for _example_either_ before or after school. The centers will also be _open_ on Saturday and _during_ the school holidays. _With_ the opening of the centers, parents will have a great burden _off_ their minds. They can be sure that their children will be well _taken_ care of in a clean and safe environment.
"Help ! Help ! It's a gang fight !"Shoppers at Marina Centre in Singapore _heard_ cries coming from the field nearby. A girl screamed, loudly and very shrilly. The fright in her _voice_ turned Daryl's blood cold. _For_ a split second, time seemed to be frozen as the horror _of_ the situation penetrated every shopper's brain. Then, all of a sudden, everybody _started_ running towards the field. It seemed as if everyone had gone mad! Daryl ran _along_ with them, eager to see part of the action.When he _reached_ the field, the fight was over. All he could _see_ was a huge crowd huddled in the middle of the field. Daryl pushed his _way_ through the crowd and stared. _Lying_ on the ground was a teenager. His face was very pale and he was covered _with_ blood. The handle of a switch blade could be seen sticking _out_ of his stomach. Daryl began to _feel_ very sick.Suddenly, a man pushed his way _through_ the crowd and called for a little space. Obediently, the people moved _back_ . Daryl was very relieved. He _thought_ that the ambulance had arrived. However, the man whipped out a _camera_ and started taking photographs of the boy, _not_ bothered that the teenager was injured. He even tried to interview the boy. Finally, help came, but it was too _late_ . The paramedics fought to _save_ the injured teenager, but failed. Daryl looked on as the corpse was loaded into the ambulance.
For many years, the blue whale was hunted _by_ men called whalers. They wanted a special kind of bone _found_ in the whale's mouth that is light and bends easily _without_ breaking. This whalebone was _used_ to make hoops for circular skirts that were fashionable _for_ women then. The fat, or the blubber of the whale was used to make cosmetics for women and whale meat was _sold_ in the market for consumption.Today, the blue whale is practically extinct. Other _types_ of whales, such as the killer whale and the gray whale, are _under_ special protection. The only species of whale that seems to have survived well _is_ the dolphin.
Tommy _rubbed_ his eyes sleepily and covered his face _with_ his blanket. He immediately _fell_ asleep again. When his mother came to _call_ him a second time, he said, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."He added, "I have a bad time in school _every_ day. The teachers always nag at me _because_ they don't like me. The students _are_ also very unfriendly. They avoid me _when_ they see me coming and they hardly _talk_ to me. Each day, I have this sinking feeling that everyone _makes_ fun of me behind my back. Can I _pretend_ to be sick today and not go to school just _for_ one day?"Mrs Dunn shook her head. "I'm _afraid_ not, Tommy," she said. "In fact, I can _think_ of many reasons why you should go to school. First, you are as _fit_ as a fiddle and have no reason to excuse yourself by _pretending_ to be sick. Secondly, you have a _lot_ of work to be done in school. Thirdly, you are the school Principal!"
Today, overweight children are becoming a common _sight_ in many countries. One possible _explanation_ for this trend is that parents nowadays tend to pamper their children a lot. They give their children plenty of money to _spend_ on chocolates, candies and fast food. _These_ foods can be very fattening. To make matters _worse_ , many children do not _like_ to exercise. They often prefer playing computer games _to_ a jog in the park.Children who are overweight can _get_ help from the Obesity Clinic. In this clinic, the overweight child learns how to _lose_ weight by eating wisely. He also learns how to eat a balanced _meal_ as well as what  _kinds_ of food to avoid. The child is _also_ encouraged to exercise regularly.A child who is trying to lose weight _needs_ all the love and support he can get _from_ his friends and family. If you have an overweight friend, do not _make_ fun of him by calling him names. This 'harmless' teasing can be hurtful and unkind _to_ him.
The country is made _up_ of volcanic rock. As the soil is infertile, very few farmers _grow_ fruits and vegetables on the land. _Instead_ fishing is the main activity. Iceland exports a great amount of fish _each_ year. If you do get a chance to _visit_ the island, you would find huge fishing fleets in the waters _around_ the country.Visitors have often been amazed _by_ the breathtaking beauty of the country. The quiet _and_ serene surroundings of the country also make it an _ideal_ place for world leaders to hold important conferences. Not long ago, talks _between_ the United States of America and the Soviet Union were _held_ in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. The _two_ superpowers discussed how to cut down _on_ arms spending to make the world a safer _place_ .
"I understand your point, sir," said Mr Moore. "I _apologize_ for my son's behaviour. _You_ see, my family has never _been_ very good at History. I think you _can't_ really blame the boy _if_ you ask him questions about events that _happened_ long before he was born.""I see," said the Principal. "But we do _hope_ that you will be able to advise Timothy to put in a lot _more_ effort in his work. Why, he couldn't _even_ answer some of the easier history questions. For _example_ he doesn't know even the year Sir Stamford Raffles died!""I'm sorry to _hear_ that," said Mr Moore politely. "We didn't even know that Sir Stamford Raffles was sick."
He lived at a time when poverty _was_ rampant. The late nineteenth and early twentieth century saw the migration _of_ many impoverished immigrants into West Europe. They came in _search_ of jobs, and many had _little_ or no knowledge of English, French or Russian. This language barrier hindered their assimilation _into_ their foster country. _These_ immigrants were often the unheard minority. Thus, they could identify _with_ the little man who portrayed their lives _so_ realistically. Oppressed by people _in_ authority like landlords, storekeepers and employers, Chaplin always got the _better_ of them. This endeared him _to_ the oppressed immigrants. He offered them a fantasy life to _take_ refuge in, and to rebel _against_ their oppressors.Chaplin's films were silent. In this _way_ , Chaplin bridged international barriers. Everyone, _regardless_ of race and language, could _enjoy_ the magical touch his films afforded.
"Whoever says doctors don't _get_ sick?" he wondered to himself. He was sure that he _had_ caught his cold from one of his patients.He wished that he could go home for a good _rest_ . However, he had promised his son, Kenneth, that he would _give_ a talk during Kenneth's school assembly in half an hour's _time_ . He glanced _at_ his prepared speech and groaned. He could now _feel_ the beginnings of a bad headache.In the end, he _decided_ that he could not possibly give a speech _in_ his condition. He drove quickly to Kenneth's school and _apologized_ profusely to the Principal. Dr Miller felt bad that he had to cancel his _talk_ as he was not feeling _well_ .During assembly that day, the Principal _made_ an announcement, "Due _to_ unforeseen circumstances, Dr Miller's talk on 'How to Keep Fit' has been cancelled."
When you are tired, the best thing to _do_ is to get plenty of rest. Sleeping is one of the best _ways_ to fully 'recharge' your tired body. Most importantly, the damage _caused_ by tired muscles is slowly being repaired _when_ we sleep.Nevertheless, sleeping is not the only way to _get_ our bodies rested. Another way to _overcome_ fatigue is by doing some activity _that_ you enjoy. For example, after a hard day's work, the office worker may want to go _for_ a relaxing walk. After a long tiring day at school, the student _prefers_ jogging to resting at home. This way of getting rid of tiredness does _work_ . When your body is tired, one way of curing tiredness is _by_ improving the body's blood circulation. When we take _part_ in an activity, our blood circulation is improved. In the end, we would become more refreshed.
Gorillas will only attack _when_ they feel threatened. This is why zoologists _studying_ these animals are careful not to observe them _through_ binoculars for long periods of time.Today, gorillas living _in_ the wild face many threats. This is because many of the forests in the world are being cut _down_ . Because the natural habitats _of_ these creatures are being destroyed, gorillas face the _threat_ of extinction in the future. _To_ help save the gorillas from extinction, some of these animals are bred in captivity in zoos all _over_ the world. The Singapore Zoological Gardens obtained _its_ first pair of gorillas in 1983. The two gorillas, _whose_ names were Saul and Goliath, were a _present_ from the Bristol Zoo in England.
This unusual workshop is _the_ brainchild of manager, Mr Vincent Ong. When Vincent _first_ introduced service packages at low prices, many people laughed _at_ him. They thought that he would not be able to earn _money_ . However, these low-priced packages _proved_ to be a big success _as_ they helped draw many customers. Today, the service station serves _up_ to forty cars a day.Vincent also _has_ other unusual practices. For example, he _sends_ birthday cards to his clients. He also celebrates _all_ his staff's birthdays at the station. At the end of the year, he would _give_ his staff gifts of electrical goods.
"You paid forty dollars for this miserable _set_ of stamps ?" Susan asked in disbelief. Michael put the stamps carefully _into_ his album. It was no _use_ telling Susan about his precious stamp collection. She, _like_ all girls, is only interested _in_ glossy fashion magazines with pouting women in designer _clothes_ and articles like 'How to lose weight _without_ eating less'.This was _no_ ordinary set of stamps. Michael had bought them _from_ Daniel as Daniel needed _money_ to buy a new walkman. Daniel said that it was a gift from his grandmother _on_ his last birthday. The stamps dated _back_ to the early part of the century. There were only a _few_ sets left in circulation today."She _said_ it's a priceless antique," Daniel had _told_ him. "My mum would be very angry with me _if_ she knew I'm selling it to you."Susan interrupted his reveries."Mother should cut _down_ on your pocket money, the way you _waste_ it on these silly stamps," she muttered.Michael felt irritated. Susan was always finding _faults_ with him about the way he _spent_ his money."What do you know ?" Michael snapped back.
In no time, Kenneth was _heading_ towards the doorway that led to the airplane. He was _filled_ with excitement. He had _waited_ a long time for this holiday to England where he would _spend_ four glorious weeks visiting his aunt. Kenneth was also looking _forward_ to his flight. He has never _been_ on an airplane before.After_ depositing his luggage on the shelves above his seat, Kenneth sat down. He was pleased to note that he was _able_ to get a window seat. Now he would get a good _view_ of the clouds when the plane takes _off_ . Next to him sat a pleasant-looking lady _who_ nodded at him amiably. Kenneth _gave_ her a broad smile and looked _out_ of the window. _From the window, he could see tiny black dots."Look! The plane is so high _that_ the people down there look _like_ ants," he exclaimed in wonder."They are ants," his companion said _with_ a laugh. "The plane hasn't even taken off _yet_ !"
In its natural state, after it is cleared _of_ blood and tissues, the bone can be _used_ to make handles for pots and pans. Interesting-looking buttons _can_ also be made from animal bones.After it is burnt, the bone may be _ground_ into fine powder to make artificial manure for _plants_ . The powder can also be used _as_ food for hens and ducks. The animal charcoal _obtained_ after the bone is burnt may be used as varnish for furniture and as a whitening agent _for_ sugar.Acids may be _added_ to the ground bones to make baking powder, the _ingredient_ that makes dough rise. Some parts of the bone are used to _make_ gelatine, a sticky substance that has many useful _purposes_ . Gelatine is made by steaming the bone _till_ an oily liquid is produced. _After_ the water has evaporated, the substance _left_ behind is gelatine. Ice-creams, jellies, glue and _even_ hair creams contain gelatine. Even the fat _from_ the bone marrow is used to make soap.You would never _have_ guessed that bones could be so useful, _would_ you ?
Now imagine that the ice is in the _shape_ of a pyramid, with only the triangular top peeping _out_ of the water. Dip your _finger_ perpendicularly into the glass and move it _towards_ the ice slowly. You will notice that your finger will touch the _ice_ under the water before you get near to the portion _above_ the water.In the past, many ships were _sunk_ in the sea because by the _spotted_ the ships spotted a glacier, they were already _too_ near it to steer the ship away to _safety_ . Probably, the _part_ of the ice under the water would already have _made_ a hole in the hull of the ship. Now, _with_ the help of radars during navigation, a glacier can be detected _under_ water, and as such, disasters can be _avoided_ .
Today, many animals are faced _with_ extinction. _The_ Californian condor, a majestic bird, and the Siberian tiger are two _such_ animals. Certain kinds of woodpeckers and alligators are also on the endangered _list_ . Some of these animals are decreasing in _number_ because people have been _hunting_ them down for their fur and skin. Others were killed _in_ large numbers in the past because they _posed_ a danger to human life.With the global trend veering _towards_ industrialization and urbanization, forests are _being_ destroyed at an alarming rate. _As_ a result, many wild animals that used to live in these forests are forced to _move_ to less fertile areas. Sometimes they simply die out in _their_ old homes when the forests gradually thin out. Hopefully, this situation can be reversed _before_ more and more animals become extinct.
Ramadan ends _with_ the celebration of Hari Raya Puasa. Muslims put _on_ new clothes to pray at the mosques and visit _one_ another. Special delicacies are prepared for the _occasion_ and non-Muslim friends are invited to _join_ in this joyous event. The Malay community in Singapore organizes _events_ such as beauty contests, variety shows _and_ ronggeng (a kind of traditional Malay dance) competitions. All _these_ help make Hari Raya Puasa one of the most important _festivals_ of the Malay calendar.
Shaka Zulu taught his tribesmen _how_ to use a short spear during war. Holding a short spear, the Zulus had to run near their _enemies_ to attack them. They also made shields _out_ of animal hide to _protect_ themselves. All these gave them an advantage _over_ the other tribes who _used_ long spears. This is _because_ once a spear is thrown, it is very difficult to remove it from the _victim's_ body.Under_ the leadership of Shaka Zulu, the Zulus conquered all the surrounding tribes and _killed_ so many people that the Orange Free State and the Transvaal nearly _became_ unpopulated. In 1879, war broke out _between_ the Zulus and the British. The Zulus were _defeated_ and the British ruled _over_ Zululand. Today, many Zulus are _working_ in the mines in South Africa. However, they still return home to the kraals, _which are traditional dome-shaped huts.
On the actual day, there was a huge crowd searching _for_ this gate at the Tower of London. Everyone _was_ baffled as no one knew of its existence at _all_ . It took some time for the crowd to _realize_ what day it was. They were _victims_ of a practical joke.Another April Fool's prank was _played_ by a British television station in 1957. On April Fool's day, this station _showed_ a documentary on farmers in Italy harvesting spaghetti. Farmers were seen _gathering_ long strips of spaghetti from trees and shrubs. Many people were actually _taken_ in by this program. It did not _occur_ to them that spaghetti is a man-made _product_ ; it does not _grow_ on trees!
In Europe, children are _taught_ to be skilful in handling food _with_ knives, forks and spoons. However, in countries _such_ as China and Korea, chopsticks are used. In _other_ countries such as India, it is _considered_ good manners to use the fingers _instead_ of cutlery.The differences _lie_ not only in the eating implements people use, _but_ also in the food itself. European children _grow_ up eating such foods as beef, potatoes and bread. In Asian _countries_ , however, people eat rice as their staple _food_ . Where most _would_ agree that duck is a tasty dish, the Japanese would recoil _in_ horror at the thought of eating ducks. _To_ them, ducks are only for ornamentation. Another _example_ of such differences would be the eating of dog meat. The Chinese _see_ dog meat as a delicacy but most Europeans would _condemn_ the practice utterly. To the Europeans, dogs are pets and _should_ not be eaten.
As soon as the rain _stopped_ , the steam began rising. _Where_ before there had been water droplets rising _from_ the surface of the road _in_ a fine mist, there were now eddies _of_ vapor curling towards the sun. If pedestrians walking along the road seemed _like_ spirits, it was because they walked _through_ billows of vapor. _If_ the trees appeared to be moving, it was _because_ they too were ankle deep in _the_ rising vapor.However, the sun was very hot, _so_ very soon the glimpses of the other world disappeared.
Night masked the land; relief _at_ her escape began to _give_ way to fear. The loneliness _of_ the desert night was very frightening. She shivered as a cold wind sprang up _out_ of nowhere. Danielle felt tears blur _her_ vision. She had been stupid and _because_ of that, she could die _here_ in this vast wilderness.Thoughts_ of snakes and scorpions lurking unseen _on_ the ground troubled her. Above her, the moon _shone_ coldly, turning the sands _into an endless rippling sea.
Last evening, I decided to go for a jog. As I was _doing_ my warm-up exercises, I heard a familiar voice _calling_ my name."Hi, Mabel ! I didn't expect to see you _here_ ," the voice said. I turned around. _It_ was my classmate, Judy. When she heard I was going jogging, she asked me _whether_ she could come along. I declined at once _because_ Judy was an excellent runner and had _represented_ the school in many competitions. I told her she would probably run circles around me. However, she still insisted _on_ joining me.We started running round the track. _After_ running for about four hundred metres, I was already _out_ of breath. I had not been exercising for many weeks and my stamina was _poor_ . Judy, in contrast, ran effortlessly _by_ my side. She _cast_ a pitying glance at me and said :"We could go at a slower pace if you like.""Hah ! You think I cannot _keep_ up with you ?" I said contemptuously.I then spent the next few minutes _trying_ to prove myself right. After two laps around the track, I could not stand it any _longer_ . I came to _an_ abrupt halt. Panting heavily, I asked Judy to continue _without_ me.She ran six more laps. i was amazed by the sheer _amount_ of energy she had. Looking at her, I was _determined_ to go jogging more often to improve my stamina.
Achilles's secret was _that_ when he was a baby, his mother had immersed him _in_ the waters of the River Styx. The magical power of the water _protected_ him from any sort of injury he would come _across_ later in life.However, there was one _part_ of Achilles's body that was not protected - his heel. His mother had _overlooked_ this; she had _held_ him by his heel when she soaked him in the river. This weakness was to _become_ Achilles's downfall. One day, in a fierce _battle_ , Achilles killed a Trojan hero called Hector. _In_ retaliation, Hector's brother shot a deadly arrow _at_ Achilles's heel. As a result, Achilles died _from_ the poison in the arrow.
Baboons will eat almost _anything_ . A troop of baboons on the _hunt_ for food will tear apart tree stumps for insects, rob orchards _and_ even invade farmhouses. With their long dog-like faces, sharp canine _teeth_ and restless disposition, it is _not_ surprising that they are often _thought_ of as the most dangerous and aggressive of _all_ monkeys.Today, baboons can be bred successfully in zoos. The _next_ time you go to the zoo, watch _out_ for the Arabian baboon. It is easy to recognize it because its bottom is bright red. The Egyptians used to worship the Arabian baboon and this is the _reason_ it is also called the sacred baboon.
Knowing such details about your best friend or loved one could also _tell_ you about the type of friend or partner he needs. For example, a boy with a younger sister would normally get _along_ much better with a girl _who_ has an older brother than _with_ a girl who has a younger brother. Similarly, _if_ your girlfriend is the oldest in her family, she would probably be more than a _little_ domineering.Fortunately _for_ all of us, family psychology is not totally accurate. There are always _exceptions_ to the rule. Most important of all, we should always judge _people_ according to who they are, not the relatives they have.
Hi! How are you? Let me _tell_ you a little of what I have been doing. Well, I'm having my long-awaited school _holidays_ right now. It's really wonderful to _have_ four whole weeks to do _what_ I like. I have been _keeping_ myself very busy. I spend my time reading and catching up with friends.Oh yes! I have also been trying to lose some _weight_ . As you know, I am a little overweight and need to _shed_ four kilogrammes to achieve my _ideal_ weight. To lose weight, I have been exercising at _least_ three times a week. I usually go swimming or cycling. Occasionally, I also invite some friends _over_ for a game of squash. I have also been _watching_ my diet very carefully. I have cut _down_ on fattening foods such as ice-cream, cakes and soft drinks. Believe me, it was a _hard_ struggle to _stop_ myself from eating these tempting and delicious foods. Finally, I have stopped my bad habit of snacking _between_ meals. _Instead_ of eating my usual packet of potato chips _when_ watching television, I would chew _on_ a carrot stick.After one and a half weeks of _following_ this routine, I discovered that I have lost one kilogramme! I am very happy with my progress and will _continue_ to do better. How are things with you? Do write to me when you are free. Bye for now!
Alexander was suffering from tuberculosis _of_ which his two brothers had died. The weather in Scotland was not _conducive_ to his health, so his father _decided_ to move to Canada in 1870.In 1873, Alexander _became_ a professor in Boston University. _Together_ with Thomas Watson, Alexander experimented _with_ electrical transmissions _of_ telegraph messages.A German, J.P. Reis, invented a telephone that _only_ transmitted music and noise, but _not_ the human voice in 1861. Alexander was convinced _that_ he could make the transmission of human voices possible. He spent many long _hours_ experimenting with the diaphragm and magnetic coil _inside_ the telephone.Finally, in 1876, he _succeeded_ , and the new telephone was born. The money he made _from_ his invention was spent _on_ the deaf. He married a deaf student, Mabel Hubbard, a year later.
At the _end_ of the song, the people in the flat above clapped and cheered loudly."That's the _last_ straw. I'm going upstairs to complain," Carol said to _herself_ . She marched to the lift and stormed upstairs. Loud strains of the _song_ 'Unchained Melody' could be _heard_ . Carol pressed the doorbell several times but there was no _reply_ . The music had _drowned_ the sound of the ringing doorbell.At the end of the song, Carol pressed the doorbell _once_ again and yelled, "Open up!" Soon, the door creaked _open_ . In the living room _was_ a group of eight tough-looking men _with_ tattoos on their arms. All of them _eyed_ her sullenly." _What_ do you want, girl?" one of them growled. "N-nothing, bye!" said Carol _in_ fright. She ran back to her flat as fast as she could.
In karate, individuals learn to _control_ their minds and bodies, replacing aggression _with_ tolerance, and pride with humility. They also _learn_ that fighting is always the _last_ resort in solving a _conflict_ . Karate instils _an_ iron-clad discipline, tutoring _exponents_ to stretch their tolerance and humility _to_ levels beyond their normal sphere _of_ experience. _Without_ the discipline, an exponent _soon_ learns, one cannot master the martial art.Unfortunately, there are _many_ misconceptions about karate. Most of this misunderstanding _results_ from the violent shows _on_ television or on the big screen. _Due_ to all these movies, karate has now become misused _through_ a lack of understanding of _its_ basic principles.
However, _not_ all mosquitoes bite. In fact, _only_ the female of the species sucks blood as they need the protein _for_ their eggs. Male mosquitoes live mainly _on_ plant juices or nectar from flowers.Mosquitoes detect their victims _by_ the carbon dioxide that people and animals breathe _out_ . Although holding your breath may not _prevent_ these creatures from detecting your _presence_ , you can still reduce the risk of _being_ bitten. The mosquito appears to be attracted _to_ dark-coloured clothing. Thus, by _wearing_ light coloured clothing, you would probably be bitten less. You could try wearing light coloured pants _instead_ of jeans the next time you _visit_ a mosquito-infested place. Surprisingly, the mosquito is also attracted to _scents_ like cologne or aftershave lotion. No one really knows why this is so.
"I can't. I _promised_ my mother I would weed the garden today," replied Alison. She put the phone _down_ a few moments later and returned to the garden sadly. As she began weeding, _all_ she could think of was her friends having a glorious _time_ at the swimming pool."Alison," called her mother _from_ the house suddenly. "I overheard your _conversation_ with your friends. Why don't you _join_ them at the pool and do this later?""Really?" _Thanks_ , Mom!" said Alison gratefully.She was out of the house in a few minutes and headed _for_ Port Miller Swimming Pool. However, _at_ the pool, Alison could not find her friends. She searched all _over_ the place but they were nowhere in  _sight_ . She also looked for them at their favorite places the bowling alley, the shopping centers _and_ the fast food restaurants. However, they _seemed_ to have vanished completely.When she _returned_ home a few hours later, her mother was waiting _for_ her at the front gate. To her surprise, the garden was spick and _span_ ."After you _left_ the house, your friends came here to look for you," her mother explained. "They had _come_ to help you weed the garden!"
Yet, ambition, _like_ money and fire, is a good servant, but a bad master. Einstein, Louis Braille and countless _other_ renowned persons succeeded because they had the ambition and determination to strive _for_ what they wanted. On _the_ other hand, there were also people like Adolf Hitler and Nero, who, _because_ of over-ambitious, failed to _become_ successful people. Instead, by _being_ slaves to their ambition, they were blinded to reality and humanity. They _lost_ the people's respect and were soon despised. Needless to _say_ , they failed in their endeavors and caused much suffering to the people they had been _put_ in charge of.Perhaps you may _think_ that people like Hitler and Einstein are far removed from _our_ ordinary lives. Nevertheless, ambition and over-ambition _are_ timeless emotions. Since the era of the cave man, ambition has led to the success and downfall _of_ many individuals. We have achieved much today, _due_ to our forefathers' ambitions and dreams. _If_ we are to progress, we will have to learn to control our ambition to help us achieve our targets.
You probably _think_ that French fries is a legacy of France. This is not _true_ . In fact, this delicious snack originates _from_ Belgium.One day, a cook in Belgium was preparing a stew _for_ his employer's guests. He chopped _up_ several potatoes into small slices to be thrown _into_ the stew. However, _while_ he was transferring the potato slices to the pot, he accidentally _dropped_ them into the frying pan. The cook stared at the potatoes _in_ dismay. He had no more potatoes _left_ in his kitchen and he did not know what to _serve_ his guests.While the cook stood wondering what to do _next_ , the aroma of fried potatoes enveloped the kitchen. The cook eyed the sizzling potatoes _with_ curiosity. He took a slice and tasted _it_ . He realized it was _delicious_ .His guests also _found_ this dish delicious. When his guests _asked_ his for the name of the dish, he told them it was 'Pommes frites' which _means_ 'fried potatoes' in French. From then _onwards_ , people began ordering potatoes _the_ French way. These potatoes eventually came to be known as 'French fries'.
It was decided that a tractor should be _used_ . One of the men dived _in_ and reported that the taut rope disappeared _into_ a mass of weeds. It was discovered that these weeds were the main _cause_ of the difficulty. Finally, _after_ many more dives, most of the weeds were cut _away_ . A new line, this time a steel hawser, was _tied_ to the object. The tractor winch went _into_ gear, and the slow pull _began_ .Then, almost unexpectedly, a huge metal segment broke the _surface_ of the lake. _As_ it was drawn into the shallows, the object revealed _itself_ to be an enormous bronze bell, drawing _with_ it a great oozy mass from the dark depths.
Our dreams may also have _something_ to do with our fears and longings. For example, if you long to win first prize _in_ a high-jump contest, you may dream of _yourself_ winning the competition. Finally, our 'external' environment may also _after_ our dreams. If we are hungry, cold or thirsty, our dreams may include _these_ feelings. For example, if I sleep in a very cold air-conditioned _room_ , I may dream that I am _on_ an expedition to the North Pole.People _known_ as psychoanalysts study and interpret dreams. For instance, they may say _that_ if you dream of flying in the _air_ you are a person who desires power. Of course, these interpretations may not be _accepted_ by everyone.
In 1768, he went_dared_ explore this ocean. The seamen before him were afraid of bad weather, typhoons _and_ fogs. Cook, however, _was_ unafraid. His ship crossed the Pacific Ocean without _any_ problems. He then started sailing towards Tahiti.At Tahiti, Cook and his crew were well-received _by_ the natives there. After this, Cook continued to sail westward. In 1769, he _became_ the first white man to set foot on the North Island of New Zealand. However, he was prevented _from_ exploring the island _when_ the fierce-looking Maoris approached his ship and _threatened_ to kill him. After sailing around the North and South Islands _of_ New Zealand, Cook continued to sail to Australia.In_ another brave voyage, Cook sailed to the South Pole and crossed the Antarctic Circle. He had sailed further south _than_ anyone before him. Near the end of his life, Cook _had sailed over one hundred and twenty thousand miles.
Today, there is a very strong emphasis _on_ the halt of CFC usage. CFCs, otherwise known as chloro-fluorocarbons, _are_ ozone-depleting chemicals. They practically burn a hole _in_ the earth's atmosphere and we, _on_ earth, suffer from the strong radiation emitted by the sun's _rays_ . Household _items_ like refrigerators, aerosol cans, air conditioners and styrofoam containers _contain_ ozone-depleting chemicals.The hole in the sky _allows_ harmful radiation to reach the earth. As a result, the temperature on earth will _rise_ . This is alarming _because_ polar ice-caps will _melt_ in the heat. Ocean levels will rise _and_ , islands will gradually be _flooded_ . More _people_ will suffer from cancer _if_ the ozone layer continues to disappear.This is _why_ governments worldwide are taking such strong measures _against_ the manufacture and continued use of CFCs. We, too, should help save the world today.
Sherry nodded her _head_ expectantly and waited for the starting signal. She was in a _most_ unusual contest, the Annual Spaghetti Eating Contest. She had never _joined_ such a contest before. Together _with_ her contest partner, Peter, they would have to gobble _up_ as many plates of spaghetti as _possible_ in four minutes. There were twelve couples _participating_ in the contest.When the competition _began_ , Sherry gulped down the spaghetti as fast as she could. For the _first_ two plates, the slippery stuff slid _down_ her throat easily and she had _no_ problems eating the spaghetti. _By_ her fourth plate, however, she felt _so_ bloated that she could hardly bear to swallow the stuff. Besides, the strong _taste_ of meatballs and spaghetti sauce in her mouth was beginning to _make_ her sick. In the _middle_ of her fifth plate, she sneaked a look at Peter. He had _completed_ an admirable seven plates of spaghetti already.Much_ to Sherry's relief, the contest ended. When the results were announced, Sherry and Peter discovered that they had _emerged_ third in the competition. What do you think their prize was? It was _one year's free supply of spaghetti at the local Spaghetti King Eating Palace!
The first Superman comic strip was published _in_ a comic book in 1938. This first story _gave_ the background of this hero by _explaining_ that he was from a distant planet. _In_ the early stories of Superman, he was not as strong as _what_ he is today. In fact, he could not fly at all.The first three issues _of_ Superman comics did not capture the public's _attention_ at once. By the fourth issue, however, Superman comics became a hit. Both children and _adults_ began to demand _for_ Superman comics. Soon, newspapers also began to _feature_ Superman comic strips regularly. _There_ was even a radio show that dramatized Superman's adventures. It was during _this_ show that well-known phrases like "This is a job for Superman" first appeared. Today, Superman is featured _not_ only in comic strips but also on television and in the cinema as _well_ .
When the owner of a sweet shop, Morris Michtom, heard of this _incident_ he was very impressed by the president's compassion _for_ animals. He decided to create a toy bear to _honor_ what the president had done. He made the bear _out_ of soft furry brown material. _This_ adorable stuffed toy sold like hot _cakes_ immediately. The _inventor_ of this bear decided to name the bear _after_ Theodore (or 'Teddy') Roosevelt. From then _onwards_ , the bear became known as 'teddy bear' .There are some people who feel that the 'teddy bear' actually _originated_ from Germany. Long ago, a German woman called Margarete Steiff _made_ soft toys for children. She _especially_ enjoyed making stuffed toy animals _like_ monkeys, elephants or pigs. One day, she _decided_ to make a stuffed bear. This toy became popular _and_ it sold instantly. Soon, the 'teddy bear' was _being_ sold in many countries outside Germany.Nowadays, teddy bears _make_ good gifts. They are well-liked not only by children but by many adults as well.
Astronomers also think that perhaps a small _amount_ of water vapor could be found on Mars. In 1887, an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, _discovered_ markings on the surface of Mars. These markings _looked_ like canals. This finding led astronomers to believe _that_ since water exists on Mars, life forms could _exist_ as well.However, there are others _who_ feel that life on Mars is not possible. This is because there is little or no _trace_ of oxygen on the planet. In 1965, the Mariner IV capsule managed to _take_ photographs of the planet. It discovered that the only forms of life found are vegetation like fungi _and_ mosses. Nevertheless, people remain fascinated _by_ the idea that one day, there could be life on Mars.
With its razor-sharp _teeth_ and huge, tough body, the crocodile has always _instilled_ fear in man. Crocodiles can attack at any _time_ of the year. They are particularly active, however, _during_ the warmer months. Contrary to popular _belief_ , the crocodile does not _kill_ its prey by ripping _off_ its flesh. In fact, the crocodile _cannot_ chew at all. Its teeth are _designed_ only for grasping its victim firmly. The crocodile _eats_ by gulping off bits of flesh and swallowing them. It then _allows_ its powerful stomach to grind the _food_ .Since World War II, the demand for crocodile skin has increased greatly. To _meet_ these demands, crocodile farms have been formed. In these farms, crocodiles are hatched and _grown_ . They are slaughtered when they are about five or six feet _in_ length. The _skin_ of the crocodile is used to manufacture handbags, belts and shoes. In Australia, the crocodile meat is even _made_ into pies, sandwiches and sausages! An estimated 1.5 to 2 million crocodile skins are sold every year.
The Chryxus artic, another butterfly, _changes_ the darkness of its wings according to the kind of rock it rests on to _blend_ with the surroundings. Some butterflies resemble dead leaves when they lie _still_ , making it _difficult_ for birds to spot them. Some shut their wings tightly to _hide_ their colorful wings. The underside of the butterflies, which is _of_ a dull color, fades _into_ the surroundings.Perhaps, the most interesting camouflage is _that_ of the owl butterfly. It has a pattern on its wings that _resembles_ the eyes of the owl. Some birds _avoid_ it because they think it is an owl! Even the butterfly larvae have _ways_ of protecting themselves; some _have_ spikes on their bodies and others give off a bad smell _when_ they are disturbed!
Laura nudged me with her elbow."Look over _there_ ," she whispered. I was surprised that she was talking to me _during_ a test, but I followed the _direction_ of her eyes. Audrey was copying her _answers_ from a piece of paper she held _under_ her desk. At the other end _of_ the classroom, Miss Brown was _busy_ marking some books."Wait till Miss Brown catches Audrey _at_ it. She's bound to be _sent_ out of class," Laura whispered.Just at this moment, Miss Brown looked _up_ . Laura was bending slightly forward _to_ my side of the table."Laura Dean, _stop_ what you are doing immediately and come _here_ !" Miss Brown shouted. Laura's face _turned_ red. Desperately trying to defend _herself_ , Laura cried out :"Miss Brown, Audrey is _cheating_ !" All eyes were directed _towards_ Audrey. Suddenly, there was a rustling _sound_ of paper from her desk. Audrey had crumpled _up_ her test paper. Then she _burst_ into tears.
Dance involves our sense of rhythm. We have an innate sense of rhythm in _ourselves_ . From the time we are in our mother's womb, the rhythmic rocking we _feel_ as she walks awakens our instinct _of_ movement. As babies, we are rocked _to_ sleep. As children, we _sing_ nursery rhymes and clap or dance _along_ to them. We have already begun dancing.In many countries, dance is indulged _in_ to cultivate discipline _and_ appreciation for one's native culture. For _example_ , in Africa, many tribes initiate their children _into_ adulthood through dance. Young children imitate _their_ parents' steps. Perfection of these steps signals their transition _into_ adulthood. _From_ ungainly, unsure first steps emerge refined steps. From there, an African is _able_ to modify the steps to convey the message he wants to tell.When we have mastered walking, we _learn_ the rudimentary steps of dance, be _it_ ballet, jazz or disco-dancing. From there, we are able to choreograph other steps _suited_ to the message we wish to convey. Ironically, we are able to be spontaneous _in_ the midst of discipline.
For some, it is to prove that it _can_ be done, no matter what others say _about_ your skinny legs or your fat middle. For _others_ , it is the culmination of a period of training, of having struggled _against_ all odds. Trying to build _up_ enough stamina and endurance to _make_ it to the finish line is not _easy_ . Therefore, _being_ able to cross the finish line at a time that would not make you blush _is_ an achievement.Many _take_ the marathon very seriously. Marathon _runners_ can reap lavish and lucrative returns, especially when you have won a few.Whatever_ your reasons are, marathons are a challenge. It is the battle of an individual _against_ himself; it is a battle _between_ your tired body and your strong mind. How determined _are_ you to cross the finish line, no matter _if you reach it among the winners or at midnight?
We are reporters, sent _here_ by our editors to cover one of history's most spectacular eruptions. We come from different _parts_ of the world, and converse _in_ different languages. Yet, we are bound by the same thing - a _common_ interest in this volcano.Now and _then_ , as if to remind us of her inherent power, Etna would _give_ a mighty rumble, and quake in _an_ awesome display of strength. She has the power to send scientists from all nations scrambling _for_ the seismological machines, measuring and checking data. It has become a game for her to _keep_ everyone guessing if this last rumble could be THE rumble that would set her _off_ . The villagers have grown _tired_ of watching Etna. She has grumbled for a long time. Their lives resume, though _more_ hectic, with the influx of tourists.
"For a few million years, this was an island inhabited _by_ reptiles and birds. _There_ were few predators and no mammals. Until humans _arrived_ in 1535, the place _was_ a paradise. When people came in their _ships_ , rats escaped from the ships _onto_ the island. They ate a lot of bird eggs and reptilian infants. Goats and cows were reared in the _island_ to provide fresh meat for the _humans_ . These animals multiplied and grazed the whole island bare."The scientist continues, sounding fierce: "Sailors discovered tortoises could _live_ for up to a year _and_ a half without food _or_ water, and claimed that their meat _tasted_ like chicken. Tortoise populations were wiped _out_ . Hundreds of thousands of tortoises were stacked _upside_ down in ship holds. The females were especially _easily_ caught as they wandered down from the lush highlands to _lay_ their eggs in the lowlands. As people settled on the islands, their livestock and pets _ran_ wild, hunting the birds and young reptiles fearlessly. These _actions_ threatened the survival of the natural inhabitants of the Galapagos Islands."
Today, the initial novelty of the MRT has _worn_ off. Many people use the MRT as it is an efficient form of _transport_ , which _spares_ one from traffic jams, especially during peak _hours_ . It also _provides_ air-conditioned comfort _at_ reasonable fares. With the _introduction_ of the Transitlink system, the MRT and the Singapore Bus Service users can now _use_ one ticket for _both_ systems. This _makes_ it even more convenient to travel on the train.The Transitlink system also represents a _joint_ effort by the MRT and SBS to integrate different forms of land transport in Singapore for more efficient _travel_ . Perhaps, one day, traffic jams will become a thing of the _past_ as the traffic on the road becomes increasingly controlled.
Glass makers work for years _before_ achieving the status of master craftsmen. They _join_ the glass works from a young age, working for a minimal pay _as_ apprentices. They soon _learn_ the trade and become ordinary craftsmen. _With_ the benefit of practice and experience, they will one day _become_ master craftsmen. If a particular cup or vase _requires_ a special rim or design, the master craftsman will handle it _himself_ . Otherwise, mass-produced glasses maybe moulded _in_ die casts.Great patience is needed to make a glass, for after it is shaped and _left_ aside to cool, it has to be given along interval to 'contract'. _If_ it is not 'aged' sufficiently, it will crack and disjoint.
The teacher's _voice_ came quietly over the intercom in her observation unit."In the First World War, many _lives_ were lost due to the way the battle was _fought_ . A deadly dance was performed daily _by_ men from both sides. They would _take_ turns to charge towards the enemy trenches, across terrain covered _with_ mines, and crawl under barbed wires. _Those_ who survived would then face heavy enemy artillery. _Under_ such circumstances, it was not _surprising_ that such charges were called 'suicide missions'.Yumei winced as rusty bayonets were _used_ to impale men who would then be _left_ to die painfully from the loss of blood, gangrene or shock. She knew that the medical facilities _were_ primitive. The surgeons did not _know_ about the need to disinfect the surgical room, nor the need to _keep_ the wound as clean as possible. Most of the young men _died_ of wounds that could easily have been healed _in_ just a few more decades.Yumei reached over and turned _off_ the observation unit. Now she understood _why_ her country censored war.
Electricity-producing fishes usually have poorly developed _eyesight_ . They cannot see well and so _need_ this extraordinary ability as a _form_ of protection and as a _means_ of getting food for themselves. _Whenever_ the fish's electric field is distorted by the _presence_ of a foreign object, the fish _is_ immediately alerted. It then produces electricity _as_ a reaction. If the foreign object _happens_ to be a potential predator, it _gives_ the fish sufficient time to _make_ its escape while the enemy is temporarily immobilized _by_ the shock. If it is a smaller fish, its next _meal_ is assured.Perhaps one day, we can learn to tap the energy of such fishes and rear a tankful of them to light our homes!
Nothing the government _does_ , no matter how _hard_ it tries _by_ providing houses, schools and medical services, ever quite _keeps_ up with the increasing population. Most people have become _accustomed_ to the sight of these homeless thousands _and_ hardly notice them.
The Italians regard wine _as_ a nourishing drink, not merely a pleasure-provoking _one_ . Therefore, they _take_ pride in producing wines of quality and flavor.In the old days, wine was pressed _by_ heavy, bulky men who would run barefoot in a tank of grapes _for_ hours. Their colossal weight pressed the juice from the grapes, _which_ was then drained aside and fermented. Today, however, there are machines which perform this _job_ under more sanitized _conditions_ .Grapes are picked in the predawn hours _when_ they are freshest and juiciest. _Before_ the first rays of the sun touch them and dry them, wine pickers are already _hard_ at work. By the time day _breaks_ , the grapes are ready to be graded. White and red wine grapes are separated to be made _into_ their respective wines. Then, only the top-grade grapes make _it_ to the wine presses. These wine presses, located in modern factories, have the _capacity_ to squeeze large quantities of grapes in a short time, a far _cry_ from their inefficient ancestors.Special chemicals are _used_ to ferment the grape-juice, and they are bottled and labelled. These wines are then stored in deep, cool and dim cellars to age maturely before they are _sold_ .
Ali rubbed his eyes as the clock slowly chimed the _hour_ . He groaned as he _thought_ of his mother. She would die _unless_ something was done. He wished he could meet Death _face_ to face. He would _kill_ Death so that Death could not take her.Suddenly, Death appeared. He _wore_ a big black cloak that _covered_ him totally. When Death walked nearer, the cloak fell _off_ his head and little blue lights shone from _where_ the eyes should have been A skeleton-like face grinned _at_ Ali. Horrified Ali stood staring at him."I am Death," he said. "Do you have _anything_ to say to me ?" His bony _hands_ grabbed Ali as he tried to _run_ out of the room.Ali swallowed hard. He had _changed_ his mind about killing Death. In fact, all he wanted to _do_ was to get out _before_ Death kills him !"Um ... I ... " Ali's _throat_ went dry and no sound came out. Death _laughed_ menacingly. His laughter made Ali's hair stand on _end_ . It did not sound like anything he had _heard_ before !
We were lucky today. There was going to be a hunt soon. We could faintly make _out_ the tawny body of the mighty lion stretched _on_ the grass below. He had been hiding there for at _least_ an hour now. He had been _watching_ the herd of gazelles for a long time.Presently, the lion saw a young buck stray _away_ from the herd. The lion stirred imperceptibly, almost flowing like a liquid _towards_ the unsuspecting gazelle.We _held_ our breath, anticipating the kill. Would that young animal get caught and _end_ up as a meal? The lion moved closer ...It happened _so_ quickly that we were stupefied. Out of the grass, a black-spotted gold cheetah sprang _forward_ and landed a hair's breadth _from_ the gazelle's side. In an amazing display of finesse, the gazelle veered _to_ one side, and _with_ a mighty leap, rejoined his mates in their _flight_ for freedom. At that precise _moment_ , the lion chose to leap. He landed on top of the cheetah, and what ensued was a furious _fight_ .The gazelles, in beautiful synchronized movements, escaped from their _predators_ .
For instance, in Africa, witch-doctors wore masks to cast _out_ evil spirits, which they believed were the _cause_ of diseases in both human beings _and_ animals. Some tribes in New Guinea consult their masks _about_ their problems, talking to them _as_ if they could reply to their _questions_ .Ancient Egyptians made masks from the skulls of _dead_ warriors because they believed that the people who _wore_ them would be able to inherit the brave _qualities_ of the dead warriors. The aboriginal totem poles, _which_ are gigantic wood carvings with faces painted _on_ them, are also masks _with_ a religious significance. You can easily _find_ them in Australia.On stage, painted masks are worn by _actors_ playing different roles. Mimes, for _example_ , are silent plays in _which_ the actors put on _different_ masks to convey various moods to the audience without _saying_ a word.
In the early _times_ , man would domesticate animals by setting traps to _catch_ their young. A young animal is far more _easily_ domesticated than an adult one. From young, the animal _learns_ to trust and obey its owner.Many different _kinds_ of animals have been domesticated. Some common _instances_ are animals like horses, elephants, chickens and pigs. The dog, _which_ is also known as "man's best friend", is one of the first animals to have been domesticated. One of the most unusual animals to have been domesticated _is_ the pig. In England long _ago_ , the pig was a wild animal. _It_ was a ferocious and aggressive creature which was not easily captured. Yet nowadays, the domesticated pig is _no_ longer the lean and tough creature it _used_ to be!
We can compare the way Pavlov's dogs reacted to the bell _to_ how some of us _answer_ our examination questions. When we _study_ for our examinations, we memorize long passages from our books. We go through past years questions and familiarize _ourselves_ with how to answer them. Finally, when we actually sit for the examinations, we _have_ prepared answers in our heads. We regurgitate _these_ answers, no matter _how_ the questions are framed. _This_ can be very frustrating to the examiner _marking_ the examination papers. Such an unthinking way of answering questions can be _described_ as 'Pavlovian'.
To _overcome_ a phobia, the person has to learn to relax _in_ that particular situation he is afraid of. In the _case_ of the nyctophobiax, he has to stay in the dark, usually _with_ a person he trusts, to learn _from_ experience that there is really no _danger_ in the dark. For more _serious_ cases, behavior therapy and hypnosis are prescribed to delve _into_ a person's subconscious to undo the unnatural _fear_ that he feels.
For example, bedrooms are usually painted in pastels, _not_ in bold colors. Blue, green or pink are generally favored _above_ black, red or orange. This is not simply a _matter_ of taste, but of sense. _Nobody_ wants to wake up to a room of overly-bright or sombre _colors_ . It has been scientifically _proven_ that moodiness and irritability are caused _by_ the excessive release _of_ acid and adrenaline into the body. _This_ could be caused by waking up _to_ incompatible colors!For centuries, villains _have_ always worn black thereby causing us to _associate_ black with evil. Likewise, red signals danger, purple implies royalty, _and_ white, purity.We should acquire dress-sense with clothes: we do not _wear_ a green blouse with a bright orange skirt, _nor_ do we wear a pink tie with a yellow shirt. We are careful to _ensure_ that our clothes do not _clash_ in color.Undeniably, color is becoming increasingly important in our _lives_ .
It is understandably humiliating to admit _you_ have failed. Yet, this is an essential prerequisite _to_ success. To overcome the main barrier to your _success_ , you have to admit that you are _not_ the great person you envision _yourself_ to be. Over-confidence can easily be mistaken _for_ confidence. There is but a thin boundary _between_ the two. Yet, the results can be shockingly _different_ . While one can help you _achieve_ your goal, the other can dash your dreams to _pieces_ .There is, therefore, a _need_ to be modest and unassuming. The _fruits_ of success will be sweeter. Using confidence and knowledge, strike firmly _towards_ your goal, and never be diverted _from_ it by a mild success. A premature celebration can easily obscure the task _yet_ to be performed.After you have succeeded, _use_ that confidence to improve yourself. Then personal progress can be guaranteed.
Anorexia nervosa is a disease because the person develops a distorted view of _how_ fat or thin he actually is. As a _result_ , he will continue to _deprive_ himself of food until it endangers his health.Anorexia nervosa is seen as a modern disease because today's culture equates thinness _with_ being beautiful. This _makes_ people who are fat, or even _just_ slightly overweight, to think that they are ugly. By losing some _weight_ , they hope to look better. The only legitimate _reason_ , however, for losing weight is for the _sake_ of one's health. _Apart_ from health reasons, one should learn to _accept_ one's looks as one grows older. Young girls, who are especially susceptible _to_ anorexia nervosa, should learn to _base_ their self-confidence in things _other_ than looks. For example, the personality of a person is more _important_ than his looks.
"Just _like_ the ghost stories I often hear," Lily thought, and giggled nervously. It didn't seem _as_ funny, though, as when she was _with_ her group of friends out in the warm sunshine. Here, _where_ the cold wind seemed to blow right _through_ one's bones, it was a different story.Suddenly_ she froze. There was no outlet for the wind to _enter_ the house! Furthermore, there was no _electricity_ , so the fans could not have been working. Fear filled her heart. It seemed to _beat _faster,_ sounding_ just like the ticking of a clock ... a big grandfather clock. Lily _turned_ very slowly to look at the clock in the corner. It was _ticking very loudly!Lily screamed and ran out of the _room_ . A ghostly laugh, mixed _with_ the cry of the wind, _followed_ her hasty escape.
A once loving and obedient child can transform _into_ a rebellious, sullen teen. What _accounts_ for this change? The problem, claim some doctors, _lies_ in the physical aspect of the person. A teenager's hormones wreak havoc _within_ his body. Noticeable physical changes occur _which_ the teen may feel uncomfortable about. In trying to _cope_ with these changes, the last _thing_ the teen needs are parents invading his privacy or _treating_ him like a child.However, the problem is, in fact, accounted for by something deeper _than_ mere physical changes. The teen is not _just_ developing bodily, he is also developing emotionally. _For_ the first time in his life, he may be painfully aware _of_ the opposite sex. The teenager is also vulnerable _to_ puppy love and crushes, the sure signs of growing _up_ . He also becomes defensive and secretive _about_ his own actions.Teenagers should be given a certain _amount_ of freedom to explore their emotions and authority. Parents need not be overly alarmed _by_ their strange and inexplicable mood changes. After all, _isn't_ that all part of growing up?
The next time you come _out_ of the shower, be careful to dry thoroughly the areas _between_ your toes before you put _on_ your socks or shoes. Otherwise, fungi might grow on your feet and _cause_ itchy blisters to appear. This is _because_ fungi grow best in warm _and_ moist surroundings. This disease is known as Athlete's Foot _because_ it often affects people _who_ exercise regularly and do not _take_ care of their personal hygiene. The fungi can _spread_ to the soles of your _feet_ if you are not careful. They can even spread to the other _parts_ of your body if you scratch the blisters.Although_ Athlete's Foot is rarely painful and serious, it _can_ be quite a nuisance. The treatment _for_ Athlete's Foot is to _keep_ the skin dry, especially in hot weather _when_ the skin sweats more. Dust your feet with powder _as_ a precaution before you go out of your house. In _more_ serious cases, fungicides and antibiotics are used to _stop the growth of fungi.
Mr Samsudin works throughout the _night_ . His job is to make sure that the _light_ comes on at 6.30 pm and is switched off at 6.30 am _each_ day. He leads a quiet and peaceful _life_ . However, as Mr Samsudin pointed out, not all days on the island are idyllic. Just _last_ night, there was a shipwreck. Some of the _survivors_ managed to make their way to the lighthouse in _their_ lifeboats. Mr Samsudin and his crew members were _kept_ busy providing them with food and clothing and calling the coast guards to send a rescue team over to search for _missing_ victims. Shipwrecks are _common_ during this monsoon season.There are six other crew _members_ who work with Mr Samsudin on the island. Not _all_ of them live on this island throughout the year. They spend a month or so at one lighthouse and move on to the _next_ one after a break of 21 days. During the day, the crew sometimes _fish_ for their dinner and sun-dry the extra fish to bring home.Mr Samsudin is commended for being a reliable and dedicated worker.
Liu An, a sage from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 25 AD) extolled the benefits of _eating_ snakes. It is believed that a bowl of snake soup keeps one warm and _improves_ one's blood circulation, thereby promoting good health.The number of snake shops in Hong Kong have _increased_ over the years. In one popular shop at the back lane of Temple Street, the shelves are lined _with_ bottles containing snakes preserved in herbs or Chinese wine. Customers _either_ buy them home or eat them prepared at the shop.At this shop, business is brisk and the proprietor is able to sell an average of a hundred snakes a day during the winter months. A bowl of ordinary snake meat _soup_ costs about S$ 3.50. However, special organs of the snake's body would cost more. These can be requested and the price may be quite exorbitant.
The shape and size of the skeleton also determine the _weight_ of a person. A person with thick bones will weigh _more_ than one with thin bones. Both may be of the _same_ height.We can test whether we have too much fat by doing the 'pinch test'. This is done by _pinching_ your side at the waistline, getting as much fat as you possibly can between your thumb and fore-finger. If there is more than 2.5 cm of it, you are probably fat.When we eat too much and do not get _enough_ exercise, the extra calories are stored as fat. Sometimes people overeat _when_ they are bored or lonely but often it is a case of not having the will power to  _resist_ food offered to them.There are many ways to get fat _but_ only two to stay slim and healthy. One is to eat less and the _other_ is to exercise more. Exercises _like_ cycling, jogging, swimming or _playing_ games burn calories quickly and keep us fit.It is healthy to be slim. However, _being_ underweight or thin is not desirable. We _need_ to have a little fat in our body to act as a padding around the important organs and also as a _source_ of energy.People who are _thin_ usually do not like to _eat_ a lot at mealtimes. Under such circumstances, they will gain weight if they take nutritious snacks in _between_ meals.
History has it that on 15th September, 1918, during the last days of World War I, a group of American _soldiers_ stumbled upon a German shepherd and her _litter_ of puppies. One of the soldiers, Lee Duncan, took a fancy to the puppies and brought two of them back home with him to California. One of the puppies _died_ on the way but the other, Rin Tin Tin, survived.Rin Tin Tin was intelligent and hardworking. It _starred_ in many of the silent movies in the 1920s and was extremely popular with children of all _ages_ . The renowned canine starred in its _own_ radio programs too and in its lifetime it _enjoyed_ the privilege of having its own car, a chauffeur and a chef.This animal star died on 10th August 1932. It was survived by its son, Rinty Junior. Rinty Junior followed its father's footsteps and _made_ feature films throughout the 1930s.
"Oh, dear! Look at the litter strewn _around_ the dustbins," Alice said in disgust. "Why can't these people _throw_ the litter into the bins instead of around them. Don't they know the objective of _having_ litter bins here in the park?""They must be real lazy bums. The environment officers _should_ come here and book them for littering the place," Belinda added.Alice and her team _picked_ up the empty packets of drinks, straws, paper and other paper products with their gloved _hands_ and put them into the litter _bags_ . They placed empty bottles and _metal_ cans in separate bags. "All these would make the recycling job _easier_ ," Miss Tan had said.The girls were busy working when suddenly they _heard_ a shout. They looked up and _saw_ an officer in uniform giving instructions to a group of people in front of him. "Good! More hands _make_ light work," Belinda exclaimed.Alice and the _other_ girls were puzzled. They wondered why the group was putting on colored jackets with the letters C.W.O. _printed_ on them. Belinda explained that the letters stand for Corrective Work Order. Those people had been _caught_ littering and cleaning up public areas like the beach was the punishment imposed on them. It is hoped that such punishment would make the offenders feel _ashamed_ of themselves for throwing litter indiscriminately.Keeping the environment clean and green is our responsibility. We need to have fresh air to live a happy and healthy life.
On that evening, Jonathon had _finished_ his business and Mrs Lim was walking home with the _plastic_ bag in her left hand when a mugger attacked her from _behind_ . He shoved her to the ground, grabbed her plastic bag, jumped onto his motor-cycle and _rode_ off with the spoils of his crime. Mrs Lim was too shocked to call for help. She stood rooted to the _ground_ ."Mrs Lim! Are you all right?" Mrs Lim recovered from her shock and saw her neighbor, Susan, looking _anxiously_ at her. "Somebody snatched my bag," she said. Then, she chuckled.Mrs Lim suffered a _broken_ arm but she remained good-humored about the _incident_ . "I only wish that there were a little more in the bag," she said.
The Night Safari on Mandai Road is a quick thirty-minute _drvie_ by car from the city. Bus commuters need only to _take_ the Trans Island Bus Service 171, get off at Mandai Road and catch Service138 across the _road_ . That would take them right to this exotic paradise of wildlife in captivity.The park stretches over an _area_ of 40 hectares of secondary jungle. It is _divided_ into halves- the East Loop and the West Loop. Animals roam _freely_ through the lush grounds. Over 90% of these animals are nocturnal and are therefore most active at _night_ . The park is _home_ to more than 1200 animals. There are over 110 species. Distinguished residents include the one-horned rhinoceros, the blue sheep and the golden jackal. The Night Safari also _serves_ as a conservation centre. Rare and _endangered_ species of animals are bred here.Visitors can either _walk_ along the well-lit walking trails to see the _animals_ at close quarters or take a tram _ride_ that weaves through the East _and_ West Loop routes. That will enable them to view the animals from the comfort of the carriage.Admission to the park is by _tickets_ which are sold at $15.45 for adults and $10.30 for children _below_ the age of 13. The Night Safari is an _adventure_ not to be missed.
Nature provides kangaroos and other marsupials with a pouch because their _young_ are born very weak and helpless. In fact, a 'Joey' as a baby kangaroo is called, is a tiny , thin mass at birth. It is not much _longer_ than three millimeters and about as thick as a lead pencil. The joey is not likely to survive _without_ the warmth and protection of its mother's pouch.The mother places the new-born baby in her pouch and _carries_ it around for six months. In six months, the joey would be as big as a puppy. However, life in the pouch is simply too good to _give_ up. So, very often the joey rides around inside with its head sticking out, far enough for it to pull off leaves when its _mother_ stops to feed on tree branches.In fact, long after it could walk and run, the joey still lives in the pouch. In case of _danger_ , the mother hops over to it, picks it up in her mouth without stopping and calmly drops it into her pouch.
The sudden awakening confused me and the dense _smoke_ in the cabin made it difficult _for_ me to find the door. I choked and gasped for breath, groping frantically for the _door_ knob. Just in time, I felt and saw a porthole. I crawled _through_ it and dropped to the deck outside.There was no apparent panic. The captain was giving out _orders_ for the safe evacuation of the _passengers_ . The crew was making frantic efforts to launch the lifeboats. All the time, the _flames_ were creeping nearer.Suddenly, someone gave me a violent _push_ . I stumbled and fell into a lifeboat. There was _difficulty_ in getting it moving. After what seemed _like_ an eternity, we were pulling away from the _ship_ . By that time, the front of the ship was a pillar of flames.Kathy had looked _forward_ to the cruise, a time to relax and recharge her store of energy. It was the first time that she was on a holiday _alone_ . Her family members and friends were unable to obtain leave from their jobs. She remembered their farewell kisses as they bid her goodbye at Collyer Quay where she had _boarded_ the passenger liner. She had been greatly impressed. The ship was a beauty to _behold_ ! There were many facilities to keep holiday-makers entertained and actively occupied. The swimming pool, the gymnasium, the billiard and _other_ games rooms as well as the theatre on board were very well managed. Activities were _drawn_ up for the next three days.It was a pity that Kathy's holiday ended that way.
In 1975, at the age of 13, Nadia _won_ the European championship for gymnastics. She became a star almost overnight. She was the 'darling' of the court. The next year, she took the all-round title and set the _record_ of scoring a perfect '10', not once but four times in the Olympic Games at Montreal.Nadia faced serious training difficulties when she grew _taller_ by ten centimeters. However, she persevered and _went_ on to win the Olympic gold again in Moscow in 1980. Her last competition was in the world student games in July 1981. She has since retired and _lives_ in California.
When I was young, I used to enjoy watching Mother cook, especially _when_ she was preparing my favourite omelettes. When the eggs _turned_ golden and Mother flipped them _over_ , I would jump and clap my hands _with_ glee.Once, when Mother was not in, I decided to fry an egg by _myself_ . _Having_ watched Mother do it so many times before, I thought I could not go _wrong_ . First, I washed the pan. Then I _poured_ some oil into the pan. However, as the oil heated _up_ , it splattered all _over_ the stove. Some of it got on my face and arms, and I cried out _in_ pain. I was terrified and did not even try to go _near_ the pan ! After what _seemed_ like eternity, the sizzling oil _stopped_ hissing. I then turned off the stove and spent the _next_ hour cleaning up the mess.After that incident, I never wanted to _learn_ cooking. Up till now, I _still_ have not learnt the art _of_ frying anything. I would _rather_ help Mother wash the cooking utensils after she _finishes_ cooking !
One morning, Dumpy was walking down the street _when_ he was spotted by a dog-catcher. The dog-catcher picked him up, _threw_ him into the back of the van, gave him a dose of gas meant to _kill_ him and drove to the nearest dumping ground.When he got there, he threw Dumpy in _front_ of a moving bulldozer. He assumed that Dumpy was dead. Dumpy suddenly _awoke_ and tried to crawl away. The dog-catcher took his rifle and shot him twice, one bullet hit his foreleg and the _other_ found its way to the chest. Dumpy kept moving forward. The driver of the bulldozer, Henry, begged the dog-catcher to put the poor dog out of his _misery_ . The dog-catcher looked at the huge pile of garbage. He did not want to _dirty_ his boots and refused to move in to kill the dog. Instead, he drove _off_ .Henry called his friends for help. They searched the dump in pouring _rain_ until they found Dumpy. He was hiding under a broken-down shack, his body _covered_ with mud and blood. They rushed the mongrel to a veterinarian and _saved_ his life.News of the incident spread. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals protested against the _way_ the dog-catcher performed his duty. The dog-catcher received several threats from animal lovers all over town. He had to seek _police_ protection. Eventually, he emigrated.As for Dumpy, he had his name engraved on his license plate which he carried proudly round his _neck_ . One hundred families offered to adopt him but Henry had grown too attached to the stray to give him up.
Many psychologists used to believe that everyone has a fixed _amount_ of intelligence and that it could be measured in a single test. Alfred Binet designed a set of tests which was given to French children in 1905. The questions were based on what the students were taught and their _answers_ were supposed to reflect how well they could use words and numbers, follow directions and _solve_ problems in a common-sense way. Binet thought these _tests_ were useful in separating the intelligent from the dull ones. Later, he decided to do more. He wanted to find out how _smart_ a child was. "If nine-year-old Felicia was smart, was she as smart as a ten-year-old or an eleven-year-old?" The answer was given in a number now known as IQ.IQ tests were conducted to test the intelligence of children in schools. However, it was later found that some _children_ who did well in an arithmetic test did poorly on the word questions. The question of how they were to be classified arose. It became clear that intelligence is not a trait like having brown eyes and dark hair. There are _many_ ways of being smart. Many schools no longer give IQ tests. Instead, children are given many different tests to find their _strengths_ and weaknesses. They are then helped to develop their strengths and get over their weaknesses.
As a reward, Serena's parents _gave_ their approval for her to go camping with her friends. Serena was elated. She had never _spent_ a night away from home. That would be the _first_ time. She felt grown-up and independent. "I can't _wait_ for Saturday to come!" she told her friends.Saturday_ dawned bright and clear. Serena had all her things packed long before _that_ day. Her friends had _booked_ the East Coast Campsite for their stay. It was _going_ to be fun. The taxi had arrived. "Have you packed in your _sleeping_ bag?...What about your toothbrush and towels?" her mother asked as they _walked_ towards the taxi."Don't _worry_ , Mum, I have everything. I can take _care_ of myself," Serena reassured her. She placed her bags in the boot, jumped into the _taxi_ and with a final wave of her hand, was _off_ to the camp.
Every morning, long _before_ anyone of us is awake, Grandma goes for her morning exercise in the park opposite our house. She _spends_ herself. You see, Grandma is a _retired_ nurse. She joined the service before the war and retired at the age of forty-five. She _continued_ to work as a private nurse after her retirement and only gave it up at the insistence of my father who felt that she should relax and enjoy life.Grandma also helps the maid to cook and do the marketing."Oh, Mum, _why_ must you tire yourself out? Let the maid do the work. Besides, she does not like it," Mandy used to tell her."Oh, but I do!" exclaimed Grandma, smiling broadly at her daughter-in-law.
The _motel_ was rather quaint and warm. The owner was Percy Williams who doubled up as a receptionist and a porter. He _greeted_ me warmly and showed me my room. By then I was very _tired_ I jumped into bed and fell into a deep _sleep_ .The next morning, I woke up feeling very much refreshed. I realized that I was _covered_ with a blanket and my _clothes_ were neatly arranged in the closet. "Mr Williams is indeed a nice man," I thought to _myself_ . I decided that I would stay on in the motel for the _rest_ of my holidays.I met Mr Williams on my way out and _thanked_ him for his service. Mr Williams was surprised. "I didn't do anything except to show you to your room last night, Miss. It must be my _wife_ who did that."" Please convey my thanks to your wife then," I said as I moved to leave. Mr Williams' next few words _made_ me freeze.I'm afraid I can't, Miss. You see, my wife died a few years ago."
When we hook our _computer_ to another computer somewhere, we would have entered what we call cyberspace. Cyberspace is actually what happens when we hook our computer to an online service or the Internet.We need to pay a _fee_ to go online using our computer, modem and the telephone. The service _provides_ bulletin boards, chat areas, information to download and access to the Internet.The Internet is a worldwide network of computers hooked up to one another. It is _different_ from online services in that no one owns it. Anyone is free to put in information or read information from there. We can do everything on the Internet. We can _send_ and receive electronic mail. We can see pictures and download files. We can chat with other people and can even _listen_ to music and watch videos.One of the most popular things that children do online is to chat. Unlike the bulletin board, the children chat with others who are online at the same time. They read _messages_ and send their reply right then and there. It is as if one is talking to another face to _face_ . The messages are usually short but can get rather confusing as the use of certain words or acronyms may not be familiar to all.
A few thousand spectators _assembled_ to view the race which was _established_ by the Mayor of Biscay village in 1987.This year, _many_ countries like the United States and France _participated_ in the race. There were _altogether_ thirteen donkeys in the race. Each donkey had an assistant to make _sure_ that the donkey _moved_ in the _correct_ direction.The _champion_ of the race won a _trophy_ and $13,000 in prize-money.
Rays cannot swim _fast_ . They are slow, graceful swimmers. They are not hunters so they do not _need_ to swim at high speed to chase their prey. They feed on small _sea_ creatures which are filtered as the water containing these small creatures _enters_ the mouth and passes over _the_ gills.There are not more than 20 _species_ of rays. Most of them have taken to live permanently near the _bottom_ of the sea. There are, however, _some_ that prefer to live near the upper layers of the sea. Eagle rays and manta rays, for example, are found to swim _near_ the water surface most of the _time_ . They even leap out of the water and 'fly' for a short _distance_ before vanishing into the sea again.Some rays are very _large_ . They have a 'wing span' of about 20 meters and weigh as _heavy_ as a rhinoceros. Because of their _size_ and look, these rays are also _called_ devil fish or vampire rays. But according to skin divers, rays are mostly gentle, harmless creatures. This is shown by some divers holding on to a ray to get a free _ride_ .
As they _grow_ bigger, they are called cats. They are able to catch mice and lizards. But not all cats like eating mice, they tend to _kill_ the mice and leave them there. Cats are really _useful_ pets. They not only provide us with _amusement_ but also keep our homes free from pests like mice and lizards.
Today, we _know_ that the earth is not a flat rectangular block; it is round. We owe _this_ knowledge to the explorers who made long voyages to find _new_ routes and discover new lands. They _kept_ accurate records of the oceans they _crossed_ and the strange lands they visited. From these records, they drew up a map _of_ the world. In this way, they ended _the_ belief of a flat world.Though we know the earth _much_ better today, the spirit of exploration has not as a result come to an end. The _desire_ for adventure, the urge to set foot _on_ a wild shore and the curiosity for far-flung _places_ are still alive. Besides, not all places on earth have been fully _explored_ . Places like deserts, mountains, oceans and polar regions _still_ have secrets and mysteries to amaze _and_ surprise us. It is fortunate for us that _there_ are still many things to be discovered which _means_ that the earth remains rich and wonderful.
It was midnight when the last guest left. I sighed heavily as I looked around. The living room was _full_ of cigarette smell and stale perfume. As I looked around, I _saw_ wet patches of spilt beer on my best Persian carpet. My antique vases were totally smashed. They had even _used_ my antique oak tables as ashtrays. These guests of _mine_ had done their best to destroy my expensively decorated living room ! What a night this had turned _out_ to be.I shook my head. The mess would _take_ hours to clear. Getting _rid_ of the smell would require days. My housekeeper would had resigned _on_ the spot if she saw the mess. i had to do _something_ fast. I could not afford to lose her _as_ she is the best cook I _have_ ever hadI had no choice. I went to the bookshelf, took _out_ the book 'The Evolution of Man' by Charles Darwin and pressed on the wall behind _it_ . A small hole in the wall appeared _on_ my right. I reached _in_ and took out a long object. Then I waved it in the _air_ . The room started to clean itself _up_ . Even the antique vases started fitting themselves _together_ so well that one could not tell they had been _broken_ . As you might have guessed by _now_ , the long object is a wand, and I am what they call a witch.

Charles Schulz, the world-famous cartoonist, came from a humble background. _As_ a young boy, Schulz used to _work_ as a delivery boy. When he _collected_ his first salary, he took the _money_ to a department store and bought _himself_ a book on cartoons. As he sat reading his book during lunch, _one_ of his colleagues came over. He asked Schulz _what_ he was reading. When Schulz _showed_ him the book, his colleague was extremely surprised. He could not _understand_ how Schulz would spend two dollars and fifty cents _on_ a book of cartoons.After_ working as a delivery boy for some time, Schulz applied _for_ a job in an advertising firm. At _first_ , all he did in his job _was_ to tie bundles of papers together. Eventually, however, his bosses discovered that he _could_ draw and do lettering. He was then _allowed_ to work on simple cartoons for his company. This was the start of his _career as a cartoonist.Today, Schulz is the creator of famous characters _such_ as 'Snoopy' and 'Charlie Brown'. His cartoons are well-loved _throughout_ the world and are enjoyed by both children and _adults_ .
If you go horse-riding, you may notice that horses wear 'horseshoes' on their hooves. These U-shaped shoes, _which_ are made of hard metal, are very _important_ to the horses. If horses do not have these shoes, their hooves will _wear_ out quickly on hard _and_ brittle roads. Hence, horses _travelling_ on rough roads tend to become lame often. _Without_ shoes, horses carrying heavy loads _also_ become injured easily.In _the_ olden days, horses did not always wear shoes. Instead, horse riders would carry the horseshoes _along_ with them. These shoes would be worn _only_ if the horses were trotting on a hard or bumpy _road_ . They were usually fastened _on_ the 'horses' feet with small _pieces_ of wire. However, riders soon discovered that this _way_ of having horses 'wear shoes' was difficult and clumsy. Often, the shoes would come _off_ .In the ninth century, riders _thought_ of a way of preventing the shoes _from_ coming off. The metallic horse shoes were heated up _to_ a high temperature and then pressed _against_ the horse's hooves. By nailing the shoes _down_ , they were securely fastened onto the hooves.
The Israelite camp was in a state of panic. They had received a _challenge_ from their enemy, the Philistines, to fight a battle. The Philistines _sent_ their champion, Goliath, a giant over nine feet tall, as their representative _against_ the Israelites. If the Israelites _lost_ the battle, they would be _made_ the slaves of the Philistines, and vice _versa_ . For forty days, no Israelite _dared_ to volunteer to fight the gigantic Philistine.One morning, David, a young shepherd, went to the Israelite _King_ to volunteer to fight Goliath. He said that his God would help him _win_ the battle. The king was surprised _because_ David was only a young boy. However, touched _by_ the boy's faith in his God, he allowed him to _fight_ the giant.Goliath roared _with_ laughter when he saw David. He was _such_ a puny boy that even the armour was too _big_ for him ! He had no weapons _but_ a sling. David was unperturbed _by_ Goliath's ridicule. Using his sling and a stone, David _hit_ the giant right between his eyes. The stone sank _into_ Goliath's brain and _with_ a deafening roar of pain and anguish, the giant fell down and died.
Louis Braille was born in the nineteenth century. When he was three years old, a tragic accident at his father's workshop left _him_ permanently blind. _As_ a young boy, Louis was hardworking and intelligent. His teachers suggested that he should be enrolled _in_ the National Institute for Blind Youths. At that time, this was the only school _for_ the blind in France.At the institute, Louis was eager to _learn_ to read and write. To his great disappointment, the few _books_ he found at the institute used raised letters. This method of reading was difficult for the blind, who had to feel slowly _each_ letter. By the time they _reached_ the end of a sentence, they had forgotten what the _beginning_ was about !Louis wanted to develop an _easier_ reading system for the blind. His idea of such a system _came_ from Charles Barbier, a French army officer. Barbier had invented a system called 'Night Writing', which was _made_ up of dots and dashes. Soldiers used this system to _communicate_ with one another during the night. Louis adapted this system for his own _use_ . He got _rid_ of the dashes and produced a simpler system _based_ on dots. For example, 'A' is represented _by_ a single dot. Many blind students found this system _much_ easier to use.This _came_ to be known as the 'Braille' system. Today, millions of _blind_ people are able to read, thanks to the work of a dedicated, young blind man.
I cleaned up the family attic last week. I had been prepared to _spend_ at least three days finishing the job. Little did I _realise_ that much more time was required.It was _not_ the accumulated junk to be tidied that _took_ up most of the time that I had bargained _for_ . What _kept_ me preoccupied was discovering the things _that_ had sentimental value, and reliving the memories that came flooding _back_ . I spent the greater part of my time running up and _down_ the stairs, yelling _to_ my wife, son or daughter, _telling_ them the history of every little item.I found my high school photographs and _remembered_ the good old days of accidentally breaking windows with baseballs. I found my son's first _pair_ of shoes. Then there was the painting of me that my daughter had _drawn_ in kindergarten. My wife's knitting, which she aborted _after_ trying to knit me a sweater, lies among the junk _too_ .So, it was this incessant reminiscing of times _gone_ by which hindered my progress. I suspect that a the end of it all, I have _just_ as much junk as before, for I could not _bear_ to throw most of the things _out_ .
On Sports Day, the field is _decorated_ with banners. Little coloured triangular flags are stuck in the ground _along_ the length of the track. The pavilion is the _most_ decorated area, especially _with_ its lavish display of rosettes and banners. In front of the pavilion _are_ three long wooden tables displaying the cups, trophies _and_ other medals _which_ would be given to the winners at the _end_ of the meet. A three-levelled _platform_ stand opposite the pavilion _with_ the figures 1,2 and 3 clearly marked on the _three_ different levels.All the _participants_ feel very nervous as they warm _up_ for their events. Bang ! As the gun goes _off_ for each race, the contestants would run with _all_ their strength. As the runners come near the finishing _line_ the crowd would _cheer_ the runners on. At the end of the day, the prize-winning ceremony would _take_ place. All the winners are called to step onto the platform to _receive_ their medals. Usually, a well-known person is asked to present the medals to the _winners_ .
James threw his hands _up_ in frustration."Mum ! I thought I told you _before_ I didn't want anybody to touch my things. Now I can't even _find_ my socks."Mother, _who_ was hanging up the laundry in the garden, replied, "They're in the second drawer _of_ your cupboard. Your jeans are _there_ too."James was horrified. "You _washed_ my jeans ! Mum, the signatures Michael, Kelvin and Eugene _are_ on it ... do you know _if_ they are still there ?"Mother shrugged her _shoulders_ . She looked genuinely puzzle. "Why, I didn't notice. The water did look very blue ..."James went into his room, pulled _open_ the second drawer and took out a pair of jeans. They were _gone_ ! All the precious things his best friends had scribbled _on_ his jeans were _now_ just patches of colour. Oh, why didn't she just _leave_ his things alone ? She hated his Bon Jovi and Madonna posters and always told him _how_ disgusting they looked. She also always _took_ the opportunity, whenever he was _out_ , to go into his room and 'put every in _order_ ', as she puts it. To James, it was _more_ like messing it up.
Not long ago, a kitten was tied in a plastic bag and then flung into a canal. It would have died _if_ it had not been rescued by a kind soul _who_ brought it to the Society for the Prevention of cruelty to Animals ( SPCA ). The throwing of this kitten into the canal is just _one_ instance of an act of cruelty towards animals.Every month, the SPCA _deals_ with animals that have been ill-treated by their owners. A common _type_ of animal abuse occurs when these pets are badly neglected by _their_ owners. Some pet owners do not _bother_ to look after their pets _when_ the poor animals are ill. By the _time_ these animals are brought to the SPCA, they are usually infected _with_ diseases. Some of _these_ diseases are so severe that it would be more humane to _put_ these animals to sleep just to _end_ their suffering. Then there are other pet owners who abandon their pets _altogether_ . These pets often suffer _from_ hunger and diseases.The SPCA _hopes_ to educate pet owners to be more responsible _towards_ their pets. Cruelty towards animals is a serious _matter_ . _Under_ the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals act, anyone found _abusing_ an animal can either be jailed up to six months, fined up to five hundred dollars, or both.
Somebody tapped me on my shoulder, I turned and saw a familiar face _before_ me. However, I could not tell _who_ she was."It's me, Maybelline. We were from the _same_ secondary school, remember ?" the girl said. I stared intently _at_ her heavily made-up face. Maybelline ? Suddenly, something clicked _in_ my brain."It's you ! I almost couldn't _recognise_ you. You look so _different_ now," I said.'Different' was _an_ understatement. She _used_ to be a plain girl in pigtails when we sat together in the same class. Now she _smelled_ of perfume and _wore_ expensive clothes. Her shoes were four inches _high_ . I had _heard_ from some of my friends that she worked _as_ a singer in a club. I could tell from her _breath_ that she smoked. I felt uncomfortable before this sophisticated person and did not _know_ how to act naturally.Fortunately for me, she was in a _hurry_ to go. Her boyfriend was _waiting_ for her, she said. As I watched her walk _away_ , I wondered what had happened to the simple, easy-going Gertrude I had once known. I _felt_ I did not know this Maybelline at all.
You must have heard of many ghost stories, but have you heard of this _one_ from Japan ? The story _goes_ like this; one moonlit night, a man was walking home along the river _when_ he saw a woman _crying_ on the bridge. He could not see her _face_ because she was sitting with her back _to_ him. However, he could see that she was crying _so_ hysterically that her whole body was shaking. The man felt  _sorry_  for her. when he went  _up_  to comfort her, she suddenly  _turned_  around. To his horror, the man I  _saw_  that she had no eyes, no nose and no mouth  _on_  her face !  _For_  a while the man stood frozen. Then he turned and ran away as _fast_ as he could until he  _came_  to the nearest inn.Once  _inside_ , he began to stammer out what he had seen, for he was trembling  _with_  fear. The proprietor of the inn, who had been bending  _down_  to clean the tables, straightened  _up_  and asked him, "Did she look  _like_  this ?" His face, too, was egg-like.The man fainted !
One day, an old and fussy millionaire entered a plush restaurant to _have_ a meal. The staff of the restaurant sighed when they _saw_ him. They _knew_ he was a man who wanted the best but _was_ only willing to pay the _least_ .A menu was _placed_ in Mr. John's hands, and the waiter _waited_ patiently as the millionaire kept changing his _order_ . Finally, he _decided_ to order a bowl of oxtail soup. Relieved, the waiter _took_ the order and promptly disappeared _before_ Mr. John changed his mind again.When the dish was _served_ to the millionaire, Mr. John called _for_ the waiter again. The staff shook their _heads_ . They knew Mr. John was going to ask for proof _that_ the soup was made with real ox tail. However, the clever waiter just smiled. He was prepared for this situation. After _listening_ to the complaint, the waiter went _into_ the kitchen and dragged _out_ an ox with a bandaged tail. Speechless, the millionaire had no choice _but_ to _continue_ with his meal.
Once upon a time, there lived a peasant girl named Arachne. Arachne was a very talented weaver _of_ wool. Her skilful fingers could create the _most_ intricate and beautiful tapestries in the world. _Everyone_ who knew Arachne admired and praised her _for_ her gift. They told her that Minerva, the goddess of weaving and handicraft, must have _given_ her this talent. Instead of agreeing _with_ them, Arachne was proud and scornful."Minerva indeed ! I'm quite sure I'm even _better_ than she is at weaving. In fact, I'm ready to _challenge_ her in a weaving contest," she said.When_ Minerva heard about Arachne's challenge, she was very angry that a mortal had _dared_ to challenge a goddess. One day, Minerva appeared _at_ Arachne's cottage and reminded Arachne of her challenge. _In_ no time, the contest began. _Both_ Arachne and Minerva started to weave, their fingers moving at lightning _speed_ . When they had _completed_ their task, everyone was astounded. Arachne's tapestry was _far_ more beautiful than Minerva's ! In a fit of jealousy, Minerva _lost her temper."You will now do all _your_ weaving in the air !" she declared. After saying this, she _changed_ Arachne into a small black hairy creature with eight legs. As the first spider in the world, Arachne was _able_ to weave the most elaborate webs.
A young soldier, _whose_ plane was shot at during the war, _landed_ his plane in a forest and escaped _with_ minor injuries. He tried to make his way out of the forest but _ended_ up walking deeper and deeper _into_ it. _As_ he wandered around, he came to an old cottage. It seemed strange _to_ him that a solitary cottage should exist _in_ the heart of the forest. All the _same_ , he thanked Fortune for _taking_ pity on him.An elderly couple _lived_ in the cottage. They took the soldier in and nursed him carefully _back_ to health. They treated him as if he _was_ their own son. When he was fully _recovered_ , they gave him precise directions to get _out_ of the forest. He was grateful to them and _promised_ to visit them again.The soldier reported _back_ to camp and told his captain of the old couple's hospitality. The soldier was shocked when the captain revealed that the forest bad been _destroyed_ by bombs much earlier in the war. The elderly couple, _who_ were officially listed as dead in their records, were the parents _of_ one of their young soldiers who had died in the war.
Getting good results in your studies comes from developing good study habits. The best _place_ to study is a comfortable room with good lighting. The best chair for studying should be _one_ which you would be comfortable _in_ , but not so comfortable that you may _fall_ asleep on it after a while ! Before you study, look for a _quiet_ environment with no distractions. If you _find_ your home too noisy for studying, try the library or community centre _instead_ .When you study, _set_ realistic targets for yourself to achieve. For example, do not _aim_ to study five chapters of Geography in one sitting _when_ you know that you take more than an hour to read one chapter. Furthermore, remember not to push yourself too _hard_ . When you have studied for a _period_ of time, reward _yourself_ by taking a short break. You could perhaps take a short walk or listen to some music for a _while_ .If you begin to _feel_ sleepy when studying, do not force yourself to go o as you may _lose_ your power of concentration. Instead, you may want to _take_ a short nap to refresh yourself. Studying may also be strenuous _on_ the eyes. When you study, it may be a good idea to _lift_ your eyes away from your books occasionally. Looking at objects at a distance or at greenery can help _soothe_ tired eyes.
When you catch a cold, you tend to feel miserable. You are tired of sneezing and blowing your nose _all_ the time. When someone in your house has a cold, you are _likely_ to get it too. This is because the cold virus _spreads_ easily. _When_ a person who has a cold blows his nose, his _hands_ could carry the cold virus. This virus is then deposited _on_ whatever he touches such as doorknobs, telephone handles _or_ shower handles. people who also touch the surfaces of _these_ things and then clean their nose would obtain the virus as well. To _prevent_ your cold from spreading, here is a piece of good _advice_ : wash your hands with soap and water frequently _so_ that the cold virus would have _no_ chance to survive.There is no actual _cure_ for the common cold. The medicine that you take makes you feel _better_ but it cannot _get_ rid of the cold virus completely. Most people tend to recover _from_ colds within a week. When you have a cold, the best thing to do is to get _plenty_ of rest. You should go to bed early and not over exert _yourself_ . Your must also _drink_ more water as fluids help to cool the throat _and_ relieve nasal passages.
Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi, a very wealthy lady, was worried. Recently, her favorite _pair_ of gold earrings and a silver bracelet had vanished into _thin_ air. Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi admitted that she _had_ never been very careful about _where_ she kept her jewelry. She often left them lying _around_ the house. However, her jewelry had never disappeared _before_ . Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi had no reason to think of _anyone_ in her household as a thief. Her three servants had been _with_ the family for more than fifteen years and had never been dishonest. They were _beyond_ suspicion. When Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi _explain_ the situation to her son, Roger, he told her he would _help_ her catch the thief.A few days later, Roger ran _into_ her room excitedly."Mom, I've _caught_ the thief!" he said, panting. Roger went _on_ to explain."I was doing my homework _as_ usual at my desk. All of a sudden, a dark shape flew by my window. It was a magpie. The bird swooped _down_ , grabbed my silver scissors with its beak and flew off again. I trailed the bird and found it depositing my scissors into _its_ nest at the end of the garden. when I reached the nest, I discovered all the items you had _lost_ . You see, Mom, birds like the magpie are attracted _to_ shiny objects."After this speech, Roger showed his mother the objects he had retrieved _from_ the nest. In addition to Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi's jewelry, there were three forks, two spoons, a thimble and a pair of scissors.
Jill was walking to her class slowly. She was worried _about_ the History test she would have to _take_ that morning. As she was reaching the classroom, a piece of paper suddenly fluttered down and _landed_ near her feet. As Jill glanced down at the paper, her heart nearly _missed_ a beat. It was the History test paper complete _with_ answers !Jill's very first thought was not to _tell_ anyone about what she had found. She would memorize _all_ the answers and do extremely _well_ in the test. After some hard thinking, however, she knew that it would be a very _dishonest_ thing to do. Besides, it would not be _fair_ to her classmates. In the _end_ , Jill returned the paper to her History teacher, Miss James."Thanks, Jill. I have been searching high and _low_ for it," said the teacher."I...I've read all the questions _already_ , Miss James," Jill confessed.Miss James _told_ her not to worry as she would think of new questions for the test. Jill's _heart_ sank. She was half hoping that the test _would_ be cancelled. Nevertheless, she did her best in the new test later that day.A few days later, the test papers were _returned_ to the class. To her pleasant surprise, Jill discovered that she had _scored_ eighty marks."You know something," she told her friends. "I could easily have scored _full_ marks if I had cheated on this test. But I wouldn't be as pleased as I am _now_ with the eighty marks I obtained."
A desert is a special region where only certain kinds of plants and animals can survive. All deserts have very _little_ water. This means that only animals and plants that can _do_ without water for long _periods_ of time can exist in the desert.Plants in the deserts are particularly adapted _to_ the dry and hot environment. _One_ well-known desert plant is the cactus. _Like_ many desert plants, this plant has very tiny leaves. As plants lose most of their water _through_ their leaves, the small leaves of the cactus help to cut _down_ water evaporation. There are _other_ desert plants that do not have leaves at all.Some desert plants survive _by_ avoiding the dry season altogether. _During_ the dry season, this plant remains as a seed and does not emerge _from_ the soil at all. When the rains come, this seed would grow very quickly _into_ a plant. It would bloom rapidly _and_ then scatter its seeds before the dry season _returns_ .Desert animals have also learnt to adapt _well_ to life in this region. The camel, for _example_ , survives well in the desert because water can be _stored_ in its body. Other desert animals _include_ rodents such as mice. These animals need very little water as they can get _all_ the water they require from their food.
Once upon a time there was a king who loved to wear new clothes. He wanted a new outfit _made_ for himself every day, until finally, the royal tailor ran _out_ of ideas for his wardrobe.The tailor _racked_ his brains and then came _up_ with a plot to teach the vain king a _lesson_ . He told the king that he would make him a special robe this _time_ . It would be the most beautiful robe in the world, but _only_ intelligent people would be able to see it. The foolish, however, would not be _able_ to see or feel the robe. To make his story sound even _more_ credible, the tailor requested _for_ a week to finish his masterpiece. The king, fascinated _with_ the idea of owning the most beautiful robe in the world _agreed_ readily to his request.The week _passed_ quickly. The king tried _on_ the robe enthusiastically. To his horror, he could not see it ! Yet, he _kept_ quiet, fearing that others would say he was foolish _since_ he could not see the robe. He pretended that he was really _changing_ into the new robe and echoed the tailor's praises _of_ the beautiful robe. Finally, he paraded down the streets unclothed, not realising _that_ all the subjects of his kingdom were laughing _at_ him, including the tailor !
You have spent a day at the seaside. At the _end_ of the day, everyone tells you how _much_ darker you look. You are proud of your tan; it makes you _look_ healthy.However, studies have _shown_ that too much sunlight can be damaging to your skin. Sunlight _contains_ harmful rays known as ultraviolet rays. Over exposure to these rays can _cause_ your skin to become dry and wrinkled. It may even _make_ you age faster ! Worst of _all_ , too much sunlight may even result _in_ skin cancer.Our bodies _produce_ a kind of pigment called melanin. When the sun blazes _down_ on you, the melanin pigment helps protect your skin _by_ absorbing as much ultraviolet rays as _possible_ . However, if you stay in the sun _for_ too long, this pigment is unable to 'cope _with_ ' the strong rays of the sun.If_ you do want to go swimming, you should take the following precautions. First, try to avoid swimming _between_ ten in the morning _and_ two in the afternoon. These are the _times_ when the sun is the strongest. It may also be a good idea to _apply a sun protection lotion when you go out in the sun.
It was a Saturday afternoon. Mr. and Mrs Kerugesu were window shopping at a shopping centre. As they stood outside a boutique, Mr. Kerugesu spotted a shiny new _weighing_ machine."Look ! It's _one_ of those modern computerized machines that tells your weight and gives you your fortune at the _same_ time. I think I shall try it," he told his _wife_ .Mrs Kerugesu, however, was not too keen _about_ the idea."Let's _not_ bother. I don't _believe_ in fortune telling," she said.Mr. Kerugesu, however, insisted _on_ trying the machine. He was very curious to _find_ out his 'fortune'. He stepped on the machine and _inserted_ a fifty cent coin. There was a soft buzzing _sound_ from the machine. A few seconds _later_ , a slip of paper emerged. Mrs. Kerugesu took the slip and _read_ it out to her husband :"Your fortune : You are a clever and _talented_ person. If you are working, you will become an employee that _every_ boss would be proud of. You will become a good leader _of_ men. Everyone will listen to you _when_ you speak. _Wherever_ you lead, everyone will follow."Mrs. Kerugesu paused _for_ breath."It's got your weight _wrong_ too," she added.
It was the time of the year for physical fitness tests again. The girls of Secondary 1B were lining up to _have_ their height and weight measured."Kate, it's your turn to _weigh_ yourself," Susie said."Let's _hope_ she doesn't spoil the machine !" somebody shouted. There was a roar of laughter. Kate, _feeling_ embarrassed, stepped onto the weighing machine."Sixty-two kilograms," said Miss Murphy as she _recorded_ Kate's weight onto the register. "Your _height_ is one hundred and sixty centimeters. Now, girls, go to Mr. Shane at the car park _for_ your sit-and-reach evaluation."That afternoon, Kate went home and had a good look at _herself_ in the mirror. There was no mistake _about_ it, she was really overweight for her height. However, she had been plump ever _since_ she was a baby.Kate decided to do _something_ about her weight. She started to go for regular jogs in the park near her house. She _stopped_ having snacks between meals. It was _difficult_ for her because she enjoyed eating. During the holidays, she even took _up_ swimming lessons from one of her cousins.Soon school reopened and she was getting _ready_ to go to school; she _found_ that her skirt was an inch too _loose_ . She went to her mother."Mum, can you _sew_ the buckle of my skirt further in by an inch ?" she asked. There was an unmistakable note of joy in her _voice_ . Her perseverance had paid _off_ .
The skunk is a creature which you probably do not want to go _near_ . What makes this animal unpopular _is_ the terrible odour it gives _off_ . The skunk has two scent glands under its tail. These glands _produce_ a smelly fluid called musk. When it meets an enemy, the skunk squirts _out_ musk in a spray. This spray is overpowering and may _cause_ sickness in the stomach. If the spray accidentally gets _into_ your eyes, you will also get temporary blindness.The skunk does not strike _before_ giving its victims plenty of warning first. the first warning the skunk _gives_ is to stamp its feet, as if it were _doing_ a little dance. _When_ this warning fails, the skunk would shake its head from side _to_ side. If the intruder _still_ does not leave, the skunk would get _ready_ to spray. Some skunks stand on their hind _legs_ to spray. Others remain _on_ all fours.Many people do not _know_ that the skunk is actually a friendly creature. In fact, it would _make_ a good pet. The skunk only sprays _in_ self-defence. It uses its spray when it feels that its _life_ is being threatened.
"I couldn't go _on_ ," Mary thought wearily. She had no idea how _far_ they had walked, or _for_ how long. It seemed like forever. She had protested once or _twice_ in the beginning that they would be wiser to _either_ remain in the jeep or return to the cool _shade_ of the trees around the oasis. Philip scolded her angrily.She stumbled and _fell_ in the sand, twisting her ankle. _Ahead_ of her was Philip. He turned and glared at her, coming back to pull her _up_ . Mary held _back_ a cry as her full weight was _put_ on her foot."Can't you try to keep _up_ with me ?" he said harshly. Mary knew better _than_ to ask him where they were going. They seemed to have been following this sandy track for a lifetime. Her face felt as _though_ it was on fire and her ankle throbbed agonizingly _with_ every step she took. Their water supply had _finished_ hours ago. She thought longingly _of_ the cool water of the oasis. Philip's outline wavered _before_ her tired eyes as she felt herself slip _into_ a world filled _with_ hallucinations and mirages.
In the beautiful highlands of Scotland, there is a lake called the Loch Ness. _In_ these peaceful surroundings, a sea monster known as the 'Loch Ness Monster' is _said_ to be living in the lake. This creature, affectionately _known_ as 'Nessie', has been reported to be seen by many people _around_ the lake. According to these _reports_ , Nessie looked like a creature _from_ the dinosaur age. It had a huge body, a small reptilian head _and_ a long neck.Does_ the Loch Ness Monster really exist ? No _one_ can tell for sure. _Ever_ since the sighting of the monster, many people have been keeping _watch_ at the lake, hoping to _catch_ a glimpse of Nessie. _In_ 1934, a doctor, Colonel Robert Wilson, even managed to _photograph_ the creature. The picture revealed a creature with a long neck sticking _out of the water.Where could the Loch Ness Monster have come _from_ ? One explanation given is that the monster _is_ a pre-historic creature which lived in the _days_ of the dinosaurs. While other dinosaurs have died _out_ and become extinct, this creature has somehow managed to _adapt_ to its surroundings and live on !
( John and Mark are having lunch in the school canteen.)John : I just heard a very good riddle yesterday. Do you want to hear it ?Mark : I love riddles. Try me.John : Listen carefully. Romeo and Juliet are dead on the floor, _with_ shattered glass and spilt water all _around_ them. A man lies unconscious, _though_ not dead like Romeo and Juliet, in the _same_ room. There are no _weapons_ , such as knives _or_ guns around in the room. Now, _tell_ me who killed who and how he or she _did_ it.Mark : (thinking _so_ hard that his forehead _becomes_ furrowed) Let's see ... the man poisoned _both_ Romeo and Juliet and he _himself_ was poisoned too.John : What an imagination you _have_ ! But the answer is no.Mark : (after a long time) I give _up_ . What happened ?John : Romeo and Juliet are fishes. The man, _who_ was drunk, had walked right _into_ the fish tank, knocking it _down_ and breaking the glass _of_ the aquarium. He himself _became_ unconscious when he slipped and _fell_ , hitting his head.Mark : Fishes ! That was unfair.John : Ha ! Ha ! Ha !
Charles Dickens, who wrote _such_ unforgettable stories as Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, was born to a poor _family_ . His father was always _in_ debt, and _when_ Charles was twelve, his father was _sent_ to prison for failing to _pay_ his debts. Young Charles had to work in a dismal factory. This terrible _experience_ continued to haunt him even _after_ he attained success with his novels. David Copperfield is the _story_ of Dickens' _own_ life when he worked in the factory. Another _character_ in the novel, Mr. Micawber, is a portrayal _of_ Dickens' own father, who was _an_ incorrigible spendthrift.Because of his humble _background_ , Dickens never forgot what it was _like_ to be poor. He was always concerned _for_ the orphaned and the destitute. He worked _through_ his books to arouse public concern for their plight. Dickens was a _much_ respected writer when he died _in_ 1870. Till _today_ , many people still think that he is the greatest of English novelists.
Mr Jones, the manager of a large company, was worried. His money was missing. When he went _for_ a meeting this morning, he had _left_ an envelope with five hundred dollars on his table. When he returned to his office _later_ , the envelope was gone. As Mr Jones always locks his office when he leaves, no one could have _entered_ it. No one _except_ for the cleaning lady, Mary, who also had the _key_ to his office. Mary cleaned his office every morning.Mr Jones sighed. He had no choice but to _summon_ Mary to his office. Mary was soon _close_ to tears. She swore that she had not seen the envelope. Mr Jones _knew_ Mary had always been an honest and hardworking worker. However, _times_ were bad for her as her husband had been jobless for several months. As Mary was the _only_ one who could have taken the money, all suspicion _fell_ on her. Mr Jones told her firmly that if she _were_ to return the money, he would not _report_ the matter to the police.After Mary left, Mr Jones sat down to resume his work. as he opened his top drawer, he found, _to_ his horror, the missing envelope. Mr Jones suddenly _remembered_ he had put the money _there_ for safe-keeping just before going off for the meeting. He felt _ashamed_ of himself for falsely accusing Mary _of_ the theft and decided to apologise to her at _once_ .
The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. Like _other_ mammals, it has only seven bones in its neck; its height is accounted _for_ by the extraordinary _length_ of the bones.Because of its long neck, the giraffe _looks_ very clumsy when it spreads out its four _legs_ and bends down to drink. It _never_ enters deep forests where it can _easily_ be caught, or even be strangled _by_ tree branches. It _stays_ only in grassland and open country and plains. It _feeds_ on leaves and not grass; picking the leaves from trees _with_ in tongue.The soft, dark eyes of the giraffe _gives_ a giraffe its gentle look. Indeed, a giraffe in the wild _poses_ no harm to other animals. Instead, it is hunted _by_ the lion for food and by man for its _skin_ which makes good leather. The giraffe can _run_ at more than forty-five kilometers per hour, even _faster_ than a horse.The giraffe occasionally fights. It does so swinging its head and horns _into_ its opponent's neck. When two giraffes disagree _with_ each other, they will sometimes fight _until_ one of their necks is broken or dislocated.
It was April Fool's Day. Victor, _being_ a mischievous boy, decided to play a trick _on_ his teacher, Miss Williams. He scooped his pet mouse, Snoopy _into_ his pocket and took it to school.In the middle of a science lesson, Victor _let_ Snoopy loose. The little creature at once scampered _to_ the front of the class. At _first_ , Miss Williams did not notice the mouse. She was writing on the blackboard with her _back_ facing the class. The mouse, however, decided to announce its _presence_ by giving a loud squeak. On hearing the _sound_ , Miss Williams turned around. _When_ she saw the mouse, she screamed at the _top_ of her voice and climbed on her table."Who brought this creature here ?" she demanded. However, no one heard her as the class was roaring with _laughter_ . Several students even laughed till tears rolled _down_ their cheeks. Miss Williams was _not_ amused." _If_ no one admits to playing this trick, I shall punish the whole _class_ ," she declared angrily.When the class heard this threat, they _stopped_ laughing. Everyone looked at Victor, expecting him to _own_ up. Victor, however, stared at the floor and did not say a _word_ . He was a coward _at_ heart.
You are in the middle of a science test. _There_ is total silence in the class. While the others are writing _away_ furiously, you are beginning to _feel_ hungry. It is nearly recess time and you are _thinking_ of how delicious a bowl of laksa in your canteen would taste. Suddenly, _without_ any warning at all, your stomach _makes_ a loud growling sound. Your classmates _start_ to giggle and you nearly die _of_ embarrassment.Why_ does your stomach behave that way ? When you are _hungry_ , your stomach begins to secrete digestive juices. The churning of these _juices_ in your stomach is what _causes_ the growling sound. When you eat something to _satisfy_ your hunger, the juices will not churn as there is now something to work _on_ . Thus, the churning of these juices _is_ the stomach's way of alerting you that it is time to _eat .Your brain also _plays_ an important part in informing you that you are hungry. There is  part of the brain _called_ the 'appestat'. Scientists believe that it is _this_ part of the brain that tells your body _when_ you are hungry as well as when to stop eating.
Sandwiches make a delicious snack any time. They are a common _sight_ at picnics and teas. Interestingly enough, the sandwich is the invention of _an_ eighteen century English Earl called John Montagu. Montagu was addicted _to_ card games. he would play these games _with_ his friends for long stretches of _time_ . Often, he even found it _too_ bothersome to stop his games _for_ meals.One day, _in_ the middle of a game, Montagu was served a meal of sliced meat _with_ bread. At that time, Montagu was playing the game that _required_ its players to cover cards one on top _of_ another. As Montagu looked at _both_ the game and his food, an idea came to his _mind_ ."I can do the same with my food _as_ well," he thought.He took a slice of bread, _placed_ a piece of meat on it and covered that with _another_ slice of bread. Montagu was very pleased with his invention _because_ it allowed him to play cards with one hand and eat his meal with the _other_ .Montagu's friends quickly caught _on_ to his idea and they named the new invention _after_ him. As Montagu's full title was 'the Earl of Sandwich', the new invention became known as a 'sandwich'.
Many years ago, there lived a couple who had a very beautiful daughter. While the husband was a man _of_ violent temper, his wife was just the _opposite_ . She was always sweet and gentle. The daughter, Alitaptap, took _after_ her mother. So it was not _surprising_ that she _had_ many admirers.Now, _among_ the men who wanted to marry her was Meopin, a rich man, _but_ a rascal. He also had a violent temper. He did not like _anyone_ to argue with him. He was picked _as_ Alitaptap's future husband _because_ of his great wealth. _On_ learning this, Alitaptap wept bitterly and _begged_ her father not to _marry_ her to Meopin. Her father refused to _listen_ .The wedding day was fixed. On the big day _itself_ , Alitaptap was _nowhere_ to be found. At first, her parents and relatives looked _for_ her in the house, but she was not there. Then they looked for her in the village. She was not there _either_ . So the villagers organized a big search party. At last they found Alitaptap, but she was _dead_ . She was _floating_ face down in a river nearby.
Do you know how a bee keeper gets honey from honeycombs ? First, he blows smoke _into_ the honeycomb. The bees react _by_ filling themselves with honey because their _natural_ instinct tells them that the smoke might be coming from a forest _fire._ In the event of this, the bees will move to a _new_ home. This defence mechanism has developed _over_ many years. This is _why_ bees rarely sting the person _who_ scrapes the bees away _from_ the honey comb. As a result, the bee keeper has made his job _easier_ to perform.Still, the bee keeper _takes_ precaution by wearing a long sleeved coat so that his arms will not be _exposed_ to the bees. He puts on a pair of gloves when he _handles_ the hives. He also wears a _hat_ with a veil so that the bees aren't able to _sting_ his face. He holds the hives carefully to _avoid_ knocking them and alarming the _bees_ . The bees are scraped _into_ new hives and they start _collecting_ nectar for making honey all over _again_ .
Someone knocked on my door one night when I was reading. I opened the door and came face to _face_ with a strange man. He was _wearing_ a pair of black spectacles and a tuxedo, _which_ was rather unusual, especially in this warm climate. In his _hand_ , he held a cane. It occurred _to_ me that I had seen this man _before_ but I could not recall when or where."Can I help you ?" I asked him.The man did not answer, but pointed his cane in the _direction_ of the backyard. When I refused to let him _enter_ , he took off his spectacles and glared at me. Held _by_ a strange force, I could not move. He wasted _no_ time in walking straight to the backyard. As he passed me, I _felt_ a cold chill envelop me. It was very strange. _Never_ before in my life had I encountered a person with _such_ power over me. A sudden impulse to scream came _over_ me, but no _sound_ came out of my mouth when I _tried_ to scream.The man suddenly reappeared, carrying a small white box. As he vanished, I realized _who_ he was. He was the previous owner of this house who had died several years _ago_ . Rumor had _it_ that he buried the ashes of his wife in a box in the backyard. I shuddered _at_ the thought. That was my only encounter with the dead !
Going to parties can be fun and enjoyable. If you are invited to a party, do call your host up early to _inform_ him whether you will be able to attend. If you want to _bring_ along someone who has not been invited along with you, you should ask for _permission_ first. Remember to _dress_ appropriately for the party. You will stick out like a _sore_ thumb if you are dressed formally whereas everyone _else_ is in T-shirt and jeans. If you are not sure of _what_ to wear, do ask your host.During the party, you may perhaps like to help your host by _offering_ to serve drinks or wash the dishes. Your host_ would _certainly appreciate these efforts. If you_ happen _to be in a party where you do not know _anyone_ , do not _try_ to monopolize the host's attention. This is inconsiderate since your host has many people to attend_ to _and cannot spend all his time with you. Instead, learn to mingle _with_ the others at the party. You could try _breaking_ the ice by introducing yourself to someone who is friendly looking.Before _you leave the party, remember to thank your host. _If_ you have the time, you could even offer to help your host _clean_ up the place.
John Amos is a salesman. He _goes_ from door to door selling vacuum cleaners. On his first day of work, he decided to sell his goods by _knocking_ on the doors of a private housing area."My first customer," he thought as he _pressed_ the doorbell of the first house. A middle aged woman _with_ curlers in her hair opened the door.John began to _explain_ who he was and the product he was selling. The next minute, the door was slammed _shut_ ."Not interested !" John heard her shout _behind_ the closed door. She refused to open the door _despite_ John's persistent knocking.John was given a similar _kind_ of treatment from the next few houses. _Feeling_ rather discouraged, he knocked at the door of the ninth household. This _time_ , the occupants of the house _let_ him in. They also _showed_ interest in his product. Encouraged by _this_ , John began to explain the merits of his vacuum cleaner. When the family _asked_ him for a demonstration, he vacuumed the place for them. _After_ the demonstration, the family, however, did not _buy_ his product. Instead, they politely but firmly told him that they would _give_ him a call if they want to buy a vacuum cleaner later.The family never called him _up_ , John suspected that they had not been really interested in his product. _What_ they had wanted was the 'free service' given by John, who had vacuumed their entire living room.
Whenever you go trekking or walking _through_ a marsh, remember to watch _out_ for leeches. Leeches look _like_ earthworms but they are a nuisance. They cling _onto_ the body of a human being or an animal and _suck_ blood from it. Although it _sounds_ horrible, it does not really hurt to be _bitten_ by a leech. The leech usually drops _off_ by itself after it has had its _fill_ . In the past, leeches were _used_ as a medical tool to suck out poison _from_ the blood !You should not _try_ to pluck off the leech from your body _before_ it has finished feeding. This is _because_ the leech secretes a liquid from its mouth which _stops_ your blood from clotting while it is in the _process_ of sucking the blood. This means that _you_ will probably bleed for a while if you interrupt a leech _at_ its meal.However, if you happen to _carry_ a packet of salt with you, rub some on the leech. It will let _go_ at once at the smell of salt.
I could not sleep at all last night. Normally, _after_ a hard day of studying, I am exhausted and would fall asleep as soon as my head touches the _pillow_ . Last night, however, I did not sleep a _wink_ . It was an especially hot and humid night. _Although_ I had the fan blowing at me, I was perspiring all _over_ . I tossed and turned in bed, _feeling_ very uncomfortable.After an hour or so, I decided to help _myself_ fall asleep by reading a book. I had heard from friends that reading a dull book can induce _sleep_ . I turned on my table lamp and began _reading_ a chapter from my chemistry text. Sure enough, I began to feel sleepy after ploughing _through_ two pages. I hurriedly tossed my book _aside_ and turned off the light. However, the minute I closed my _eyes_ , my mind was flooded _with_ the numerous chemical equations that I had read. I tried to _make_ my mind blank but could not do so. I even _resorted_ to counting sheep to make myself sleepy. _Despite_ all my efforts, sleep simply would not come.In the end, I gave up trying to sleep. I sat up in bed and gazed out of my window. _Although_ dawn was approaching, there were still a few twinkling stars in the sky. In the stillness of the night, only the crickets could be _heard_ . Lulled by the chirping of the crickets, my eyes _grew_ heavy. However, just as I was about to _doze_ off, my alarm clock rang. It was time to be up and about.
There are many people belonging to different organizations, who try to _feed_ the hungry, heal the _sick_ and educate the ignorant. The problems of the poor are so great that it seems _only_ large organizations with huge _amount_ of money could ever hope to _solve_ them. However, one woman has _done_ a lot for the poor in Calcutta by going to the _poorest_ of the poor people alone _with_ only a few coins in her pocket. This remarkable woman is _known_ as Mother Theresa.In 1948, Mother Theresa set _out_ alone, wearing a white sari _made_ of cheap cotton cloth, with a blue border and a cross on the shoulder. She went to _stay_ with some American nursing nuns to get some medical training. She _needed_ the nursing skills so that she could be of _help_ to the poor. Then, in a little cubicle given to her _by_ a poor family, she opened a school. She _taught_ the children of the slums how to read and how to _keep_ themselves clean.Mother Theresa had no money _except_ for those few coins, no food except what she was _given_ . Soon, however, some of the girls she had taught came to her aid, and so the work of helping the slum dwellers of Calcutta _began_ to expand.
People like you and I keep pets like dogs, cats or guppies. my friend, Jennifer, however, had a most _unusual_ pet -- a snake called Cecil. Cecil was a small black snake less than one meter in _length_ . Some people were a little _afraid_ of Cecil because his fangs _looked_ threatening. However, he was a harmless creature _that_ did not bite. He was an extremely friendly creature and would even _allow_ strangers to touch and pet him. If you _put_ your hand out, Cecil would even slither _up_ your arm and coil _around_ your hand. Cecil's skin felt cool, dry and _not_ at all slimy.Cecil's home was a large green tank. To make him _feel_ more comfortable, the tank was laden _with_ his favourite branches and leaves. Surprisingly, Cecil _needed_ very little nourishment and he would eat an _average_ of only once a month. His favourite foods were lizards and live insects _like_ beetles and flies.Unfortunately _for_ Cecil, his life was cut _short_ unexpectedly. One very hot afternoon, Cecil _took_ a nap in the sun. When his owner found him later _in_ the evening, she discovered that he had _died_ from heatstroke !
"Don't forget the sandwiches!" Mother reminded me. We had been _preparing_ for this family picnic for two days. Everybody, _especially_ my little brother, had been looking _forward_ to it.All of a sudden, dark clouds started to _gather_ in the sky. Soon, it began to drizzle, and _before_ long, it was pouring _cats_ and dogs. The picnic _had_ to be cancelled.I was sulking on the sofa _when_ Mother suggested, "Why _don't_ we clean up the house ?" Soon, everyone was _busy_ doing something. We dusted the furniture and _threw_ away old magazines. The store room was purged _of_ many things we had conveniently stashed _away_ inside. Father painted the cabinet, _something_ he had always said he would do but had never got round to doing. I found many old photographs and had a good laugh _over_ them. My little brother polished the glass table _so_ well that we could see our reflections _on_ it clearly.At the end of the day, we were all exhausted. _As_ the family gathered round the dining table _for_ a dinner of pizza, we were glad that the day had turned _out_ well.
"I will never forgive her," Anne muttered as she walked away _from_ the class. Panting and running _after_ her, Lilian came up _to_ her and apologised profusely _for_ accidentally spilling chocolate milk all _over_ Anne's new bag. Anne _refused_ to listen to Lilian. She cupped her _hands_ over her ears, glared at Lilian _and_ screamed."I'll never talk to you _again_ !" Then she ran away.Anne was _still_ angry when she reached home. She banged the door hard _behind_ her and woke Granny from her afternoon _nap_ . She was rude to Mother when Mother asked her what she _wanted_ for dinner. She _pinched_ little Tony when she found that he had messed _up_ her room again. Tony ran howling _to_ Mother. His poor arm was red _from_ Anne's pinching."What's the matter _with_ you today, Anne ?" Mother came into the room and asked. "You've made everybody upset _since_ you stepped into the house. Did something _happen_ in school ?"
One of the lines from my favorite song _goes_ like this : "Love is something you do, not what you _say_ ... "Indeed, we often say that we love our families, but when was the _last_ time you took the effort to _bake_ a cake for them or sit down to _talk_ to them ? Do you _take_ time to find out what has been _happening_ in their lives ?Most of the time, we would rather _watch_ a movie or simply hang _out_ at shopping centers with our friends _than_ spend time with our family. People tend to take their families for _granted_ because they have lived with them their whole _lives_ . They do not feel the _need_ to be considerate to their families, unlike being so to their _friends_ . This is _because_ their families would always accept and love them _just_ as they are. It is usually when a person leaves his family that he _realizes_ how important his family is to him. He will then appreciate the warmth and love that a _family_ gives.Try loving your family now not with words, but by your _actions_ . Cultivate a good relationship with your family members and learn to appreciate each of them as the unique persons they _are_ .
Dear Diary,I had a most unpleasant experience this morning. I was shopping _for_ a birthday present at the Tiffany Gift Shop. After deciding _on_ a beautiful musical box for Sharon, I proceeded to the cashier to pay. As I was _walking_ out of the shop, I was apprehended _by_ tow fierce looking men. They _introduced_ themselves as the security guards of the shop and _accused_ me of shoplifting. I stared at them blankly and _opened_ my mouth to protest. However, before I could _say_ a word, I was practically dragged into a nearby office.The two men insisted on _searching_ my handbag. I allowed them to do _so_ since this was the only way to prove my _innocence_ . To my horror, one of the men drew _out_ a pen from my bag. The price _tag_ on the pen carried the name of the gift shop. In a flash, I _remembered_ that I had absent-mindedly slipped this pen _into_ my bag after examining it. I explained to the two men that _it_ was an honest mistake but they would not listen. In the end, I was near tears and demanded to _see_ the manager.Unlike_ the security guards, the manager was a kind and benevolent-looking man. He told me not to _make_ the mistake again and _let me go. What an embarrassing incident !
There are many strange partnerships in the world. Crocodiles and sharks are _known_ to be ferocious carnivores. yet, they would not _attack_ each other for anything in the world.The crocodile has a little bird as a friend too, the plover, _which_ lives on the crocodile's back. The plover is often seen _inside_ the crocodile's wide open mouth, hopping daringly near it sharp teeth. This special friend _of_ the crocodile picks out little bits of food _between_ the reptile's teeth. It _also_ pecks leeches and fleas from its gums.The shark has a penchant _for_ fresh fish, but it would _never_ eat the tiny shoal of fish which swim beneath its belly. These fish are called sucker-fish and they _perform_ a two-fold function. They lure larger fishes _toward_ the shark and they clean up the _remains_ of the shark's meal at the end of _its_ feast.The rhinocerous and the buffalo, too, _have_ their helpmates. These come in the _form_ of tick-birds and egrets. They ride on these grazing bovines' _backs_ , feeding on the fleas and ticks which _would_ otherwise harm these animals. Fleas and ticks suck the blood _of_ these animals and transmit diseases _to_ them.Such partnerships, known as symbiosis, _are_ common in the animal kingdom.
Albert works as a lifeguard at a beach resort. His _job_ comprises of sitting on a high chair at the beach area and _keeping_ a sharp lookout for anyone in the water who could be _in_ trouble.Albert meets _all_ kinds of people. They include families _with_ small children, elderly folk as well as young, energetic teenagers. One morning, Albert was sitting in his 'high' chair as _usual_ when he heard a  voice _saying_ , "Excuse me, lifeguard." Albert looked _down_ from his chair. An anxious looking, bespectacled middle aged man stood below, _holding_ a pail."Excuse me, lifeguard," the man repeated. "Do I _have_ to pay you for getting water from the sea ?"Albert was puzzled. No one had ever asked him such a _question_ before. He decided that this man _must_ either be a country bumpkin or a lunatic."Oh, you have to pay fifty cents for _each_ pail of water you collect," said Albert jokingly. _Much_ to his surprise and amusement, the man paid him.Albert soon forget the incident _during_ the course of the day. In the late afternoon, however, he saw the man _again_ . As it was _low_ tide, the water level was much lower than _in_ the morning. When the man saw this, his eyes _grew_ wide with amazement."Why, you must have made a lot of _money_ this afternoon," he exclaimed to Albert.
The origins of the Olympic Games can be traced _back_ to ancient Greece, to as _far_ back as 776 B.C. It was a Greek tradition to _hold_ athletic competitions every four years _in_ honour of their gods or dead heroes. There were also competitions to _pit_ their skills in music _and_ poetry.The prizes awarded to the _winners_ of each event in those _days_ were a crown of olive and a palm branch. _Although_ this may seem meaningless in modern times, the true _prize_ lay in the honour of having won the event. The winners were _treated_ as heroes in their hometowns; they were _given_ places of honour on public occasions. In some towns, they were even exempted _from_ paying taxes.The first modern Olympics was held in Athens in 1896. _Since_ then, nations from around the world have been meeting _every_ four years to compete _against_ one another. New Olympic records are _set_ every time they meet. The only _exception_ to this quadrennial event was in 1944, _when_ the Olympic Games was not held _because_ of the Second War.
One of my favorite cartoons is a Walt Disney production. Donald Duck's nephews bought him a box of cigars _for_ his birthday but hid it from him as they wanted to _surprise_ him. Donald became _suspicious_ of his nephews when he saw them acting strangely. He _followed_ them secretly to their hideout and rummaged _through_ their things.When Donald Duck found the box of cigars, he _jumped_ to the conclusion that his nephews were _smoking_ in secret. He was furious and rounded _up_ his nephews. _In_ his anger, he refused to listen to his nephews' explanations. He stuffed three cigars into _each_ of their mouths and forced them to smoke _till_ they nearly went blue _in_ the face. In contrast, there was a satisfied smile on Donald's _face_ . He thought he was _punishing_ them justly for being naughty.When Donald _came_ to the last cigar, he saw a note attached to it that said: "Happy birthday, Uncle Donald!" It was _then_ that Donald remembered that his birthday was drawing _near_ . Only then did he piece things _together_ in his mind. He was so ashamed of himself that his face turned as _red_ as a tomato. He felt so small that he shrank to the _size_ of a thumb !
Birthdays are very special occasions. We like to _celebrate_ these occasions by having birthday cakes and presents. We also take delight _in_ throwing birthday parties and inviting our friends to _come_ over. During these parties, games like Treasure Hunt, Charades or Musical Chairs are enjoyed by _both_ the young and the young _at_ heart. In Latin America, there is a popular birthday _game_ called 'Breaking the Pinata'.A pinata is a fairly large, round object _made_ from hardened newspapers and paste. It has a hollow center which is _filled_ with sweets, chocolates and toys that children love. The outside of the pinata is lavishly decorated _with_ colorful strips of paper. Before the party _begins_ , the pinata is usually hung in a high _place_ such as the ceiling of a room.During the party, _each_ child would be blindfolded and _given_ a long stick. The children would then use the stick to poke hard at the pinata and try their _best_ to break it. Sooner or _later_ , the pinata will break. When this happens, the contents of its hollow center would spill _out_ and come tumbling _down_ . The delighted children would then scramble _about_ to collect as many presents as _possible_ . As they are still blindfolded, they will have to grope _around_ for these gifts. What an enjoyable way to celebrate a birthday !
This is a story that happened during the days of Robin Hood and his merry men. One day, the Sheriff of Nottingham decided to _hold_ an archery contest. Many archers from _far_ and near came to pit their skills _against_ one another. In this contest, each archer would aim _at_ a circular disc. _Right_ in the middle of the disc was a gold circle and nay one who shot at _this_ spot would get the most points. Every archer was to shoot twelve _times_ .In the final round, there were only two teams _left_ . One of the teams _consisted_ of Little John and his two friends. The other team went first. They did extremely well. Little John's two friends _also_ performed well.It was Little John's _turn_ to shoot. In order for him to win the contest, he would _need_ to hit the gold circle nine times out of twelve.Little John was an expert archer. He stood calmly and performed an incredible _feat_ , his first seven arrows all hit the gold circle. The crowd went wild _with_ delight. His next two arrows, however, _missed_ the mark completely. With only three arrows left, Little John had to hit the gold circle twice to _win_ . His tenth shot hit the bull's-eye !Now, Little John only needed one _more_ hit to win. His next shot, however, missed the gold circle narrowly. This meant he had only one _chance_ left. As the spectators held their _breath_ , he took careful aim and hit the gold circle. The cheer that came from the crowd _was_ deafening. Little John and his team members were rewarded generously by the Sheriff.
Many of us might not have _had_ the opportunity to _visit_ Egypt, but you _must_ have seen pictures of Egyptian mummies and the tombs _that_ they are placed in. Some of these tombs are breathtaking _in_ grandeur. The Great Pyramid at Giza, _one_ of the landmarks of Egypt today, is the _tomb_ of the Pharaoh (the Egyptian name _for_ a king) Cheops.To_ the ancient Egyptians, the tomb is the real home _of_ a human being and therefore, he works hard _during_ his whole lifetime to furnish it comfortably for his _death_ . When a rich Egyptian _dies_ , his body is embalmed _with_ a huge amount of special herbs and salts to _preserve_ it. The body is then placed in a tomb to further protect it _from_ harsh weather. The dead man is _buried_ along with his material possessions, which are to _provide_ for his needs in the new world where he is supposed to _go_ . Oil, furniture, pottery and copper tools have been discovered in some tombs. In one tomb, archaeologists found a whole _meal comprising porridge, pigeon stew, fish and bread !
It was a hot afternoon. The scorching sun _shone_ mercilessly on the little village. As usual, the place was quiet. I groaned to myself as I hastily wiped _off_ the perspiration on my forehead. I would never get home _in_ this heat.As I walked along the main road, a dog _came_ rushing at me from an alley. It has foam all over _its_ mouth. _Somebody_ shouted:" _Take_ cover ! Rabies ! Mad dog !"On hearing that, I quickly glanced _around_ . All the doors to the houses were bolted. No windows were _open_ either. Nobody was _taking_ any chances. I saw a tree nearby. I ran to it and started _climbing_ , manfully ignoring the painful _bites_ of the ants in the tree."I would rather be bitten by these insects _than_ by a slavering dog," I thought at that time.Two men holding a wire noose on a long pole walked stealthily _towards_ the dog. They gauged the distance between them and the dog and neatly lassoed the animal. The dog struggled to _free_ itself _but_ the wire was thick and strong. Most importantly, the wire did not _break_ .That night, and _for_ many nights after that, my bottom was _too_ sore for me to sit down. Maybe being bitten by the dog would have hurt _less_ after all !
I will always remember the trip I made to the zoo in 1988. It was then _that_ I caught measles from one of my friends, Peter, who had gone _along_ too. _Before_ he met us at the zoo, he had gone to _visit_ his cousin who was recovering _from_ measles. The next day, Peter was complaining _of_ a sore throat, a bad cold and high fever. When he was diagnosed _by_ a doctor as having measles, his parents rang _me_ up to warn me that I had been exposed _to_ measles too. By the next day,  I was also _showing_ the same symptoms. My doctor advised me to _stay_ at home for the next two weeks.I was quite pleased _with_ the doctor's instruction. I spent the time _reading_ storybooks, listening to music _and_ watching television. When I get _bored_ , I would call up Peter, who _also_ had to spend two weeks at home, for a chat. Unfortunately, the two weeks passed _too_ quickly. When we _returned_ to school, we had to work twice _as_ hard to catch up with our classmates. It was definitely not _worth_ the 'holiday'.
It is often said that _if_ you want a pet to look up to you, get a dog. If you want a pet that looks straight _at_ you, get a horse. For an animal that looks down _on_ you, the cat must surely _fit_ this description.Cats are their _own_ bosses. They have _little_ or no regard for anyone or anything. If you have _ever_ looked closely at the cat, you will observe that it looks at you _from_ the corner of its eyes, almost condescendingly. If you call to it, it appears to consider if _responding_ to your call is worth its _while_ . When it finally decides to humor you, it will swagger _towards_ you, sit itself an inch away from you and start washing _itself_ . It seems to say, "Well, _get_ on with it, I don't have all day !"Cats are creatures of _habit_ . At precisely the _same_ time every day, my cat would perform the task he had been doing the day before. _When_ to mew like a whistling kettle _gone_ berserk, for its food; when to scratch the front door to be _let_ out; when to leap _onto_ my unsuspecting head in the morning ... these are all done _with_ clockwork regularity.
It was past midnight. We were walking _along_ the beach enjoying the cool sea _breeze_ . Then one of us spotted _what_ we had come to look for. _Out_ of the sea came a giant leatherback turtle, crawling slowly _onto_ the beach. It had a great hard shell upon its _back_ and used its huge flippers to _move_ about effortlessly.The turtle _reached_ the middle of the beach and began digging _away_ at the sand. Large scoops of _sand_ were flung everywhere as the turtle worked _in_ deep concentration, oblivious _to_ our prying eyes. When a deep _hole_ had been dug, the turtle settled over it _for_ ten minutes. As it got up, it began _covering_ the hole with sand again.In the bright moonlight, we could see numerous round, white _eggs_ . In a month's _time_ , tiny turtles will hatch _from_ them. These baby turtles would all crawl to the _sea_ as if guided by instinct and swim away. When they reach adulthood, they _too_ would return to this spot to lay their eggs.
How does a camel survive in the desert ? Many people think that the camel _stores_ water in its hump, but the hump is really made _up_ of fats. That is why you can tell a healthy camel _from_ a sick one by its hump ! A firm and tall hump indicates good _health_ while a soft and flabby one is a _sign_ of weakness.When a camel _cannot_ find water, it passes less urine to conserve _the_ small amount of water it has _in_ its body. Furthermore, the camel has a higher body temperature than _that_ of most mammals. This means that it starts to sweat _at_ a higher temperature than that _which_ human beings, for example, _start_ to perspire. This also helps it to _keep_ water loss through sweating to a minimal. Moreover, in _man_ , the loss of water thickens the blood. This is what _makes_ man need water. In a camel, its cells can release some of _its_ water content to dilute the blood.These are the reasons why a camel can go _without_ water for up to thirty-four days at a _time_ . Because of its unique ability to adapt _to_ desert conditions, it is no _wonder_ that the camel is the chief means of travel in the desert.
One day, a boy named Narcissus went hunting in the forest. _While_ he was resting, he discovered a silvery pool of water. Looking at the water _made_ Narcissus very thirsty. He bent down for a sip to _quench_ his thirst. When he gazed at the clear surface of the pool, he saw a face looking _back_ at him. A pair of big bright eyes looked at him from a lovely face _framed_ by soft golden hair.Narcissus was fascinated _by_ this picture of beauty. He felt that it was the most beautiful face he had _ever_ seen. On an impulse, he bent forward to _kiss_ the face. However, he discovered that his lips touched _water_ instead. A sudden realization dawned _upon_ Narcissus."Why, it's _only_ my own reflection that I _see_ in the pool ! I _must_ be the most miserable of all men to _fall_ in love with my reflection !" he cried.Each day, Narcissus would stare at his reflection _in_ despair. One day, he could not stand it any longer."Goodbye, my love," he told his _reflection_ . He then _jumped_ into the pool and _drowned_ himself.Today, we call someone 'narcissistic' _if_ the person is vain and egoistic. Like Narcissus, this person is in love with _himself_ !
What would you do if you _won_ a million dollars in a contest ? _Would_ you spend all your money shopping for toys, clothes and books ? Would you rather take a trip _around_ the world ? Perhaps, you might _deposit_ all the money in a bank and live _on_ the interest it earns for the rest of your _life_ .Many rich people in history have _put_ their millions to worthwhile causes such as _building_ schools and hospitals. They have _donated_ their money to support orphanages and other charitable organizations. We call _these_ people philanthropists. These millions have brought _joy_ to the lives of many people. The Tan Tock Seng hospital, for _example_ , remains an important convalescent place today, _for_ people with infectious diseases. Until today, the _schools_ that Lee Kong Chian built still exist to _fulfil_ his vision of educating young people. _Though_ both these philanthropists died many years ago, _what_ they did with their money is _still_ a blessing to many Singaporeans.Would you, then, _part_ with your wealth to further the good of _other_ people ?
It was a bright and sunny day. Mr. Smith lay contentedly on his picnic mat at the beach as his _children_ built sandcastles nearby. After some time, he dozed _off_ . He woke up suddenly when he _felt_ large drops of water on his forehead and nose. When he opened his eyes, he saw that it was no _longer_ sunny. The dark _clouds_ in the sky indicated that a storm was _approaching_ . He could see lightning _flashing_ in the distance. Mr. Smith ordered his children, _who_ were swimming in the sea, to come out of the water at once. Soon, his eldest son came running."Dad, I think we can seek _shelter_ under those trees," said his son pointing to a _clump_ of trees nearby."No, run to the car at once," Mr. Smith said.When they were _safe_ and sound in the car, Mr. Smith explained :"During a thunderstorm, you must be very careful _about_ safety. First of all, you must never swim _during_ a storm. Water is a good _conductor_ of electricity and you may get electrocuted if lightning should strike the _water_ . Another thing you must remember is _that_ seeking shelter under trees during storm is a foolish _thing_ to do. Lightning tends to strike at _tall_ objects and if you wait under a tree, you may be _struck_ by lightning. So the best thing to do is to _lie_ down flat in a low place."
The jigsaw puzzle was invented as an educational tool. In _the_ eighteenth century, a map maker called John Spilsbury thought of a way which makes _learning_ geography an interesting experience for children. _What_ he did was to paste maps on large blocks of wood. He then sawed the wood into _small_ pieces and put them into a box. Children had fun _putting_ the interlocking pieces together to _form_ a complete map. _While_ they did so, they also learnt more _about_ the geography of the world.Today, the jigsaw puzzle is not only _used_ for learning, it is also an entertaining way to _pass_ time. Jigsaw puzzles now come in all kinds of _shapes_ and sizes. Very young children can be _kept_ occupied with large, colorful jigsaw puzzles. For adults, _more_ complicated puzzles of at least one thousand _pieces_ could prove an interesting challenger.If you are resourceful, you may even _want_ to create your own jigsaw puzzle. All you _need_ is an interesting picture, a _piece_ of wood and a small saw. First, glue your picture firmly _onto_ the wood. Next, use a soft pencil to outline _how_ you want your jigsaw to be 'dissected'. When this is _done_ , you can then saw the wood into small pieces.

About one _out_ of ten people is left-handed. As the _majority_ of the population is right-handed, the left-handed person may face problems in _performing_ his every day activities. For example, the left-handed person may have difficulties _using_ objects that are made for right-handed people. These objects _include_ can-openers, scissors and certain musical instruments.Why are some people left-handed ? One theory for _this_ is that our body is 'asymmetrical'. This _means_ that both halves of our bodies are not _exactly_ the same. For example, your right foot may be slightly larger than your left _one_ . Your right hand may be different in appearance _from_ your left. This kind of 'asymmetry' takes _place_ throughout the entire body.When we come _to_ the brain, there is a left half and a right half as _well_ . These _two_ halves have very different functions. The left half of the brain deals _with_ logical functions such as reading and writing. The right half, on the other _hand_ , helps us to think creatively. For people who are right-handed, it is the left side of the brain _that_ predominates. For left-handed people, however, the reverse is _true_ . For them, _it_ is the right side of the brain that is dominant. Thus, such people would tend to use the left side of their bodies in _whatever_ they do.
The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is a tragic _one_ . Orpheus is one of the most famous musicians _in_ Greek mythology. Whenever he _played_ his lyre (an instrument that _looks_ like a harp), it was said that not _only_ wild beasts _but_ even rocks and trees were moved to follow him.According to the legend, Orpheus' wife, Eurydice, died shortly _after_ their marriage from a fatal snake _bite_ . Orpheus loved Eurydice so much _that_ he went to the underworld to _ask_ the Queen of Hades, Persephone, to allow his wife to live _again_ . Charmed _by_ his music, Persephone agreed, with a _condition_ that Orpheus would not _turn_ round to look at his wife until they reached the human world.Thus, Eurydice was released. While fleeing _from_ Hades, Orpheus could not _resist_ the urge to look at his beloved wife. Moments _before_ they reached the human realm, Orpheus looked back. It was a tragic mistake.Once he _set_ his eyes on Eurydice, she disappeared, her soul _never_ to be retrieved again. Orpheus, heartbroken and guilt-ridden, was left to mourn _for_ her for the rest of his life.
Once upon a time, there was a man called Rip Van Winkle. He was a likeable _but_ lazy man who never did an ounce of _work_ in his life. His wife was always nagging _at_ him for being so lazy.One day, to _escape_ his wife's nagging, Rip Van Winkle took a stroll in the woods. In these mysterious woods, he encountered a _group_ of old men with long beards. _When_ they saw Rip Van Winkle, they offered him a drink from a flask. Rip Van Winkle took a _sip_ and found the drink delicious. As he was very thirsty, he drank to his heart's _content_ . Immediately after the drink, he felt his eyelids becoming heavy. Before he knew it, he had _fallen_ into a deep sleep.When he _woke_ up, the sun was shining brightly."I must have slept the whole night," he thought to _himself_ .As Rip Van Winkle _made_ his way home, he discovered, to his astonishment, that the landscape around him had changed. As he approached his village, he was even _more_ dumbfounded. He found that he could not recognise _anyone_ in the village ! Not only _did_ the people look different, they were also _dressed_ in a different fashion. Everyone was staring at his chin. As Rip Van Winkle looked _down_ at his own chin, he realised, to his surprise, that he had _grown_ a very long beard.After _making_ some enquiries, Rip Van Winkle realised that one hundred years had passed from the time he drank the liquid _to_ the time he woke up. This meant that he had been asleep for one hundred years !
Many rivers and lakes around the world are polluted. The discharge of _waste_ materials by factories and households _causes_ pollution to rivers and lakes. The Rhine River in Europe and the Great Lakes in North America _are_ good examples of a river and lakes that are polluted. Their _water_ cannot be drunk.The _same_ thing is happening to the sea. In _one_ instance, certain factories in Japan dumped industrial waste _into_ the sea. Many people suffered _from_ lead or mercury poisoning _after_ eating fish caught in such polluted waters. Pollution in certain areas of the sea _is_ now reaching dangerous levels. Many ships discharge their waste materials _and_ unwanted engine oil into the sea. These wastes _contain_ lead and mercury which are poisonous. Sometimes, accidents _to_ oil tankers can cause oil to be discharged into the sea and _onto_ the beach.In _addition_ to discharge from factories and sewers, pollution can also come about as a _result_ of politics. Individuals _who_ want power deliberately place the living things in the sea _at_ risk. In a recent example, many barrels of oil were deliberately _poured_ into the Gulf to _prevent_ ships and soldiers from attacking the annexed shores of Kuwait.
One night, there was a raging storm in the village. I had just finished my dinner and was settling _down_ in front of the television when I heard a loud rumble of _thunder_ . It was _followed_ by a flash of lightning. Within minutes, large _drops_ of rain were falling and a furious wind was tearing _at_ the rooftops and trees.I leapt _to_ my feet, remembering the few clothes I had left outside my window. As I _reached_ the window, I was just in time to see my entire clothes line flew _off_ into the night, my shirts and handkerchiefs flapping madly in the _wind_ . I chuckled to _myself_ , imagining a seagull meeting _them_ in mid flight.The dark night was illuminated _by_ constant flashes of lightning. Between _these_ brief flashes, I could see much of what was _happening_ in the village. Many fishermen had hurried to the edge of the sea _where_ their little fishing vessels were moored, and were pulling them further _up_ the beach. Further inland, the women were tacking storm nets to the _ground_ over their precious crops to minimize the damage _caused_ by the wind and rain. The children were rushing madly _about_ , collecting stray pets, chickens and goats into the protective _shelter_ of sheds and houses.
William Tell was a folk hero of the Swiss during the fourteenth century. At _that_ time, the governor of the country was a cruel and proud Austrian man _called_ Gessler. One day, Gessler thought of a new plan to _make_ fun of the Swiss. He _hung_ his cap on a pole at the market-place and ordered _everyone_ who passed by the pole to bow to it. The people did not want to _obey_ this ridiculous command but they _dared_ not disobey Gessler. Just then, William Tell and his son came _to_ town.When Tell and his son reached the pole, they were ordered to bow to it. Tell boldly walked _past_ without bowing. This _act_ of disobedience angered and humiliated Gessler. As Tell's punishment, the cruel governor _commanded_ that an apple should be _placed_ on the head of Tell's son. _If_ Tell could hit the apple, he would be allowed to go _free_ .The boy was led to a tree some distance _away_ . Tell took two arrows out of his quiver and _took_ careful aim. The watching crowd _held_ their breath. a second later, Tell fired. The arrow _split_ the apple into two, penetrated the tree trunk and _left_ his son unhurt. As Tell hugged his son _in_ relief, the governor said:"You really are a wonderful archer. But tell me, _why_ did you take _two_ arrows out of your quiver when you _only_ needed one just now ?"Tell looked at the governor squarely _in_ the eyes and said:"If the first arrow had _missed_ the target and I had killed my son, the second arrow was meant for you."
Mr Martin is a physical education teacher. This was his first P.E. lesson with Secondary 2F, the _most_ badly behaved class in the school. As he _walked_ to the running track, he saw forty pairs of eyes _looking_ at him suspiciously."Okay, let's begin," he said and then started to _lead_ the class in warm-up exercises."Sir," said a voice. "Can I race you _round_ the track instead ?" someone said.Mr Martin looked _at_ the direction of the voice. It was Shaun who had _spoken_ . Shaun was _the_ school's fastest runner. This was the usual challenge he _posed_ to every P.E.. teacher. Mr Martin opened his mouth to decline the challenge _but_ something about Shaun's defiant attitude made him _nod_ his head instead."Okay, _just_ once around the track," he said.The _rest_ of the class gathered around the track excitedly. It was the first _time_ any teacher had responded to the challenge. When the race began, Mr Martin ran _at_ a steady pace. Shaun, who was slightly ahead, was _indeed_ a very good runner. What Shaun _did_ not know, however, was that Mr Martin was also an excellent runner and the _holder_ of several local track records in the 1980s. _Although_ he was already thirty-five years old, Mr Martin still _showed_ the zest and energy of a much younger man. Just _before_ the finishing line, he slipped past Shaun to win the race.The class was shocked as Shaun had never been _defeated_ before. _After_ an awkward moment, Shaun held up his right hand, a _look_ of new found respect in his eyes. Mr Martin _shook_ the hand solemnly. The class clapped and cheered.From that day onwards, Mr Martin had no problems in dealing with Secondary 2F.
Why do people yawn ? No one seems to know the exact _answer_ . Some people believe that we yawn _because_ we do not have enough oxygen in our bodies. In _other_ words, we yawn to breathe in _more_ oxygen. People also believe that yawning is associated _with_ boredom. For example, _during_ a monotonous and dull lesson, you may feel bored _to_ tears. At that time, you are _likely_ to yawn very often.Yawning can also _be_ contagious. Have you ever had the _experience_ of a long wait at the doctor's clinic ? During the wait, someone may _give_ a long, tired yawn. When this _occurs_ , other people in the room may start to yawn _too_ .A psychologist, Dr Robert Provine, did some studies _about_ yawning. In one of _his_ experiments, Dr Provine asked his subjects to record _down_ the times of the day _when_ they yawn. He discovered that yawning is _most_ common during two times of the _day_ - the hour before sleep _and_ the hour after waking. He concluded that yawning is related _to_ stretching. People tend to yawn when they stretch _themselves_ .Dr Provine also _had_ several other interesting findings. _One_ of these findings is that people who read about yawning would start yawning. In fact, according to him, people _who_ think of yawning would start yawning.
It was an unusually dark night. In the _middle_ of an enjoyable dream, Jim thought he heard his dog _barking_ loudly. He groaned and glanced _at_ his clock sleepily. Twelve o'clock the green fluorescent _hands_ of his clock read. Suddenly, Jim _heard_ hushed voices outside his house. He immediately became alert and jumped _out_ of bed. As his parents had gone on a holiday. Jim was _alone_ at home. He decided to _investigate_ who was outside.As_ he walked towards his bedroom door, Jim, however, became afraid. He wondered who _could_ be outside his house in the dead of the _night1_ . His imagination began to run _wild_ . He pictured in his _mind_ armed robbers who were waiting to break _into_ the house. He even imagined supernatural forces _such_ as ghosts and werewolves. In the end, Jim _changed6_ his mind about going out of the house. _Instead_ , he locked his bedroom door and crawled _under_ his bed. With his heart in his _mouth_ , he waited for the intruders. Suddenly, _there0 was a clicking sound and he heard the front door open."Jim ?" said a familiar _voice_ . It was his father ! Jim felt weak _with_ relief. His parents must have returned _home_ earlier than he had _expected_ . What a fright they had _given_ him !
Ryan was very excited. He had been selected to _represent_ his school in the National Inter-School Decathlon Meet. A decathlon is a sport competition that _consists_ of ten individual events.On the _day_ of the competition. Ryan was at the competition grounds early. There were five other participants _besides_ himself. The first _event_ was the one hundred meters dash. When the gun _sounded_ , Ryan ran as fast as his legs could _carry_ him. To his disappointment, he only _came_ in second.As the day wore _on_ , Ryan became more and more discouraged. He had obtained  number of second and third _placings_ but he had not won a _single_ event. During the tenth event, the500 meters run, Ryan did his best, _but_ only managed to come in third. With a heavy _heart_ , he walked away, feeling that he had let his school _down_ . To his astonishment, he saw his schoolmates rushing to congratulate _him_ ."You did it, Ryan ! You won !" they shouted.Ryan _was_ dumbfounded."How _could_ I have won ? I did not _even_ win a single event !" he exclaimed.His coach _who_ was standing nearby, explained:"In a decathlon, you get a _number_ of points for each event. So what is important _is_ not just to win but to do consistently well _in_ all the events. _This_ will enable you to score many points. You won because you scored the _most_ points overall. Congratulations, Ryan. The whole school is _proud_ of you."
One dark and stormy night. Peter and Tom were at a bus stop after watching a late night show. They were _waiting_ for the bus to go home. The bus that had come earlier was _so_ crowded that they could not _even_ get on it.Ten minutes later, _another_ bus arrived. This time, there were only a few _passengers_ in the bus. The two boys _stuck_ out their arms to flag it. However, the bus driver ignored them and whizzed _past_ without stopping. The boys stared after the departing bus _in_ dismay. It was past midnight already and they were still not home. Their parents _would_ probably be worried sick by now.Finally, the _third0_ bus came. Strangely enough, this bus was _moving_ very slowly. The slow _speed_ of the bus, however, did not bother the boys. They dashed _up_ the bus happily and headed _for_ the back seats.As the boys looked _around_ for the conductor, they realized to their great shock that there was no one in the bus _but6_ themselves ! Not even the driver was _there_ . As the boys sat petrified, they suddenly _heard_ two voices."I'm very hungry," said the first _voice_ ."I think there's some food left in the bus," _another_ voice replied.The boys did not wait to find out _where_ the voices came from and who they belonged to. They dashed _out_ of the bus and ran as fast as their legs could _carry_ them. If they _had_ stayed in the bus a little longer, they _would_ have heard the first voice say:"Hurry up and push harder. What a night for our bus to break down!"
One cold morning in January, a businessman called Joyce C. Hall was rudely awakened by the shrill _ringing_ of the telephone. As he held the phone, the caller told him a piece of bad _news_ . Hall was informed that a fire had completely _destroyed_ his warehouse in Kansas City.Hall _was_ shattered initially. He sold cards for a _living_ and his entire stock of cards had been left in his warehouse. Among the cards lost _was_ a huge consignment of Valentine's Days cards _which_ Hall had recently ordered. These cards alone had caused him to _incur_ a debt of seventeen thousand dollars. Even the insurance money he would obtain because of the fire was far from _enough_ to allow him to pay _back_ his debt.Any _other_ person would have been completely devastated by this disaster. Hall, _however_ , was undaunted. With the help of a local banker, he managed to _get_ his company working again. By the end of that year, Hall began to print greeting cards bearing _his_ own designs.At that time, the _practice_ of sending greeting cards was seldom heard _of_ . Hall realized that he could _start_ a whole new trend. He discovered that if people came _across_ greeting cards that were beautifully drawn, they were likely to send these cards to one _another_ . Hall started to _print_ attractive, elegantly drawn Christmas cards. When these _became_ a huge success, he also printed cards for special _occasions_ like birthdays or anniversaries.Today, Hall's cards are sold in America as well as all _over_ the world. _If_ you go to a gift shop today, you are _likely_ to see the name of Hall's company -- Hallmark.
The whale is the largest mammal in the world. _Since_ the whale is shaped like a fish, why is it still _considered_ a mammal ? The fact is that the whale _did_ live on land a very long time ago. However, _during_ its thousands of years of living in water, the whale gradually _became_ structured like a fish. Thus, the whale has _adapted_ to marine life. Nevertheless, though the whale _resembles_ the fish externally, it still _has_ the characteristics of a mammal.One important difference _between_ a whale and a fish is that the baby whale is _born_ alive. It is not _hatched_ from an egg. Furthermore, the baby whale is fed _on_ its mother's milk just like other mammals.Unlike _other_ sea creatures, the whale is a warm blooded animal. It keeps _itself_ warm in the cold water with a layer of blubber. 'Blubber' is a layer of oily tissue _that_ protects the internal organs and retains heat.Fishes breathe _through_ their gills. Whales, however, have lungs _instead_ of gills. They breathe by using nostrils _found_ on the top of their heads. When they dive into the water, these nostrils are _closed_ so that no water can enter. Every few minutes, the whale rises _from_ the water to breathe. When it blows _out_ the used air from its lungs, water shoots out from its nostrils. _This_ creates a 'fountain' that we usually _see_ in pictures of whales.The biggest whale, the blue whale, is also the largest animal in the world. It can _grow_ to be more than one hundred feet long and is commonly found in _the_ Pacific Ocean.
The sky was getting darker by the minute and strong wind was _blowing_ across the field. Soon, _drops_ of water were falling down _from_ the overcast sky.Peter did not _mind_ the rain at all. It was _better_ than playing under the hot _sun_ . He liked the _feeling_ of rain on his face and the cold sensation _when_ it soaked through his football jersey.His team had been _practising_ hard for the tournament. It had been two years _since_ they last won the Inter-Constituency Football Cup. Last year, in the game _against_ Rockingham, their team had lost _by_ just one goal. They were determined to win the Cup back this year."Goal !"His team had _scored_ again. Peter wanted to _score_ the next goal. If only he could get _past_ the two defenders, he would be able to _kick_ the ball into the goal easily.He did not _get_ to score his goal because the rain was pouring too _heavily_ and the field was getting too wet. As the boys ended their game and walked _across_ the field, Peter sneezed. he felt and unpleasant tingle of coldness running _through_ his body.
Jerry is the son of a wealthy businessman. One Tuesday afternoon, his chauffeur surprisingly did not _turn_ up to fetch him home from school. Jerry paced up and _down_ impatiently for half an hour. Just when he had _decided_ to take a bus home by himself, a white Mazda drove _up_ . Two burly men wearing dark sunglasses were in it. Jerry did not like the _way_ they peered at him intently from their car. Before he could say _anything_ , one of the men got out of the car quickly."Hello, you _must_ be Jerry. Your chauffeur is sick today, so your father asked us to take you back _instead_ ," the man said as he _opened_ the car door for Jerry.Jerry, however, stood rooted _to_ the spot. He was extremely suspicious _of_ the two strangers and had _no_ intention of going with them. However, before he could decline their _offer_ , he was roughly shoved _into_ the back of the car. The next moment, he _felt_ something hit his head and he fell unconscious immediately.When he came to his _senses_ , he discovered that he was in a small dark room. His hands were tightly tied _together_ behind his back with a rope. _Although_ Jerry was tired and thirsty, he was still very alert. He could _hear_ his captors talking in loud voices in the next room. they were discussing the _amount_ of money they should be able to _collect_ from Jerry's father. Jerry felt a cold chill run _down_ his spine. He _realized_ that he had been kidnapped. His kidnappers would probably demand a huge _ransom_ from his father before they would be willing to _release_ him.
In some countries, a machine known as a lie detector is used to _help_ in criminal investigation. The lie detector is used to determine _whether_ the person involved in the crime is telling the truth or _not_ .How does such a machine work ? When a person _tells_ an untruth, certain body reactions may _occur_ . For example, his heart may _beat_ faster and his face may flush. His blood pressure may _also_ rise and his breathing may _become_ quicker. It is the _task_ of the lie detector to record these reactions. Normally, the machine _would_ record reactions which the subject has no control _over_ , such as his blood pressure, respiration or pulse.How reliable _are_ these machines ? Some countries do not use lie detectors _as_ they feel that these machines are not totally reliable. in fact, the success _rate_ of the lie detector depends greatly _on_ the sensitivity of the machine.The ability of the person _conducting_ the test is also very important. The examiner must know specifically _what_ kinds of questions to ask his subjects. The examiner would usually familiarize himself _with_ the details of the case first. He then asks his subjects _questions_ that are totally unrelated _to_ the case. The answers to these questions would _help_ the examiner gauge what _the_ 'normal' reactions of the subject _are_ . After this, the examiner would ask questions of _two_ kinds -- those that are important to the case and those which have nothing to _do_ with the case at all.
Where _did_ this game originate from ? Some people have the _opinion_ that the game probably originated from Persia. This is because the word 'chess' is derived _from_ the Persian word `shah' which means 'king'. However, _others_ have argued that it could have been started by the Buddhists in India. According to Buddhist belief, any kind of killing is _considered_ wrong and sinful. Thus, chess was actually invented _as_ a substitute of war! No one, however, _knows_ the exact origin of the game.The individual chess pieces too have _undergone_ several changes. In ancient _times_ , the king could be captured and the game could _still_ continue. This would not be _possible_ in today's game. The piece _that_ has undergone the most changes is the queen. Today, the queen is _regarded_ as the most powerful piece in the game. In fact, when you _lose_ your queen, you feel as if you have lost the game _already_ Back in the old days, however, the queen was the weakest piece on the _board_ It could _only_ move one square at a time.Today, chess is well-known _throughout_ the world. Thousands of books have been _written_ about this game. Many people, young and _old_ , also take _part_ in chess tournaments.
When we _reached_ her house, Aunt Rebecca was on her way out."Sorry, boys," she said. "I've got to _go_ and collect my laundry. Please help _yourselves_ to your lunch in the kitchen. I'll be _back_ very soon."In the kitchen, we found a large pizza."It smells delicious," said Douglas, sniffing the _air_ ."Don't be fooled," I warned, eyeing the pizza _with_ distaste. "The last time she baked us a pizza, I had indigestion _for_ days."We sat down for a few seconds, debating _what_ to do. We dared _not_ eat the pizza but we did not want to hurt Aunt Rebecca's feelings _either_ . She happened to _be_ our favourite relative. Just then, Aunt Rebecca's two Alsatians bounded _into_ the kitchen. Douglas and I looked at _each_ other. The _same_ idea was forming in our minds.After we had _fed_ the pizza to the dogs, we heard Aunt Rebecca opening the front door."Boys, I'm back," she called. " _Did_ you enjoy your lunch?""Oh _yes_ , it was delicious," Douglas and I chorused."Glad to _hear_ that," said Aunt Rebecca. "I had _no_ time to cook so I bought the pizza from the restaurant nearby."
Of_ all these creatures, the one that has fascinated man _throughout_ the ages is the unicorn. The unicorn is believed to be a creature that _resembles_ a horse. Yet, _what_ makes it so distinct is that it has a single horn _growing_ out in the middle of its forehead. This beautiful creature lives alone in the forests.In medieval Europe, some people had _claimed_ to possess the unicorn's horn. According to them, the horn was believed to have magical _properties_ . When pounded _into_ fine powder, it could be used to _cure_ diseases. The horn was _also_ precious in another way; it could be used to _detect_ any trace of poison in drinking water.No man has _ever_ captured the unicorn. In Europe, there was a legend that the _only_ way to capture a unicorn is to leave a young girl in the forest all by _herself_ . When this happens, a unicorn would come by and lay its head _on_ her lap.Do unicorns _really_ exist? These creatures were said to have been sighted _as_ early as 400 B.C. However, there is no scientific _proof_ of their existence. Many people have actually _mistaken_ antelopes for unicorns. For a long time, the rhinoceros, _with_ its single horn, was also thought to be a unicorn.
One_ peaceful Sunday evening, Mr Richard was washing his car at the car porch _while_ his wife was in the kitchen _preparing_ the evening meal. It was _then_ that he decided to test whether his wife was _really going deaf."Is dinner ready, dear?" he _called_ . His wife continued to wash the vegetables without _saying_ a word.Mr Richard was beginning to _get_ a little worried."Is dinner ready, dear?" he said in a _louder_ voice. Again, there was _no_ answer from his wife. Mr Richard's alarm _grew_ . He decided to _try_ one more time."Is dinner ready?" he shouted.Once_ again, his wife ignored his _question_ and began peeling the potatoes. By now, Mr Richard was convinced _that_ his wife was indeed going deaf. He marched _into the kitchen and said:"Nancy, .I think there's something _wrong_ with your hearing. Why _didn't_ you answer me when I asked you _whether_ dinner is ready?"Nancy looked up _from_ her work."But I did answer you," she protested. "I said 'Not yet, dear!' loudly - three times!"
There are several different types of fossils. In some _cases_ , the actual remains of the organism are found to be preserved. How is _such_ a fossil formed? When an animal _dies_ , its body would naturally decompose.However, certain _parts_ of the animal's body, such as its bones or shell, take a long _time_ to decompose. _If_ this animal is quickly buried _in_ soil or rock, its bones or shell would stand a good _chance_ of being 'unspoilt' or preserved. A good _example_ of an animal that is preserved this _way_ is the mammoth, a huge furry animal _that_ resembles an elephant. Under the ice in Siberia and Alaska, whole mammoths are _found_ to be preserved.In most cases, however, we do not find the actual remains of the plant _or_ animal. This is because these remains have _already_ disintegrated. In _these_ cases, the fossils found may just _be_ the cast or mould of the bodies of animals; just like how a piece of jelly would _take_ the shape of the mould it is contained _in_ .The study of fossils is important because it is _through_ this study that we know what types of plants and animals existed on _earth_ long ago. Fossils are also able to _tell_ us about how life evolved. For example, with the study of fossils, we _know_ that the elephant is descended _from_ a creature the size of a pig!
Her first period was _with_ Secondary 1G. The class was _unusually_ quiet today. She entered the door slowly, peering cautiously at the _top_ of the door to see if there was _any_ bucket of water balanced _there_ . Much to her _relief_ , she found nothing there."Good morning, Miss Jackson," chorused the class, grinning from ear _to_ ear. Miss Jackson eyed _them_ suspiciously. _One_ popular trick her students loved to play was to switch classrooms _with_ the next class. Today, however, her students had not _changed_ classes.As the period wore _on_ , Miss Jackson grew more and more puzzled. She had expected all kinds of tricks but there were _none_ . No one took _away_ the chalk from the blackboard. Neither was there _any_ strange noise from the class. In fact, the class had never behaved so well _before_ Miss Jackson became increasingly tense. In the _end_ , she dismissed the class early and walked out _with_ a most confused look on her face.After she had _left_ , there was an uproar from the class. "Best trick we _ever_ played," said someone. "The best trick to play _on_ Miss Jackson is simply not to play any trick at all!"
The people _who_ suffer in a war need not _only_ be the losing party. There are always two sides _to_ an argument. _Both_ warring parties will inevitably sustain casualties, and it is the people who pay _for_ all the senseless damage. _In_ a war, the soldiers _may_ be enemies to each other, but _they_ are still somebody's father, brother, son or husband. Someone will _grieve_ for them if they _die_ .Our generation in Singapore is fortunate _because_ we have not had the misfortune to go _through_ a war. Our parents and grandparents had to suffer _during_ the Japanese Occupation. Many lost their loved _ones_ then. The Second World War had been the product of a few power-crazed leaders. We should prevent _such_ tragic events _from_ recurring in the future. We should do our utmost to preserve peace, first in our _own_ lives, and then in others. Only then can we live in _harmony_ with one another.
"Must be a _piece_ of chewing gum or something," he muttered as he _bent_ down to remove the object. What he removed _from_ his shoe was a dirty fifty dollar _note_ !"Wow! What good luck! _Let's_ go and celebrate with this _money_ ," said Willie. "I happen to know a good restaurant _where_ we can go for a nice meal.""All you can _think_ of is food, Willie. No _wonder_ you need to go on a diet," I said. "I think we should invest the money _in_ a few good books.""You boys can _only_ think of yourselves," Laura chipped in. "I imagine that the owner of this fifty dollar note _must_ be anxiously searching for it _all_ over the place. So I suggest we look around to see _if_ we can find the owner."For the next few minutes, the three of _us_ agreed about what we _should_ do with the money."Er, there's something you guys _ought_ to know," Jim interrupted suddenly.We all turned to him. In _the_ heat of our argument, we had forgotten all _about_ him. "What is it, Jim?" Laura asked impatiently. Jim was the most quiet _member_ of our group."Well, _while_ all of you were busy arguing, a big gust of wind _blew_ the money out of my hand," Jim said.
