# Readcompdata - data for the Readcomp project
This is the main repository for the data used by [readcomp](https://github.com/acciochris/readcomp).

## File structure
The data for each model is kept in a folder with the same name as the model.

Inside each folder:
* `dataset-metadata.json`: a metadata file for uploading to Kaggle datasets
* `scripts/`: utility scripts for downloading and cleaning the data
* data files
  
Please follow the README in each folder for more details.
